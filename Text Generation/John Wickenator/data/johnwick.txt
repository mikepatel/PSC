FADE IN:



           EXT. THE COUNTRYSIDE - ESTABLISHING - EARLY DAY



           SUPER:

           A verdant landscape of rolling hills, lush countryside, and
           ambient peace.



           EXT. THE WICK HOME - ESTABLISHING - EARLY DAY

           A small, quaint, two-bedroom farmhouse: a   classic. Nearby, a
           small barn -its paint chipped, wood worn-   sits nestled within
           the setting. The homestead feels slightly   abandoned, the
           facade -especially the roof- in dire need   of an overhaul.



           INT. THE WICK HOME - THE MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The hour hand of an old, electric clock shifts slightly,
           marking six a.m. A soft alarm sounds. Beneath the blankets,
           a body shifts, a weathered hand reaching out to silence the
           antique.

           A beat... a sigh... a groan... and JOHN WICK -early sixties,
           salt-and-pepper hair, three-day beard, former boxer, former
           military, tired, beaten down, and at wit's end- sits up,
           staring unblinkingly out at the day.

           A beat... and he stands, donning a weathered robe and a pair
           of slippers. John stuffs his hands into his pockets...



           INT. THE WICK HOME - THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           ...and shuffles down the corridor, the walls overflowing with
           family pictures, each badly in need of dusting. They
           catalogue a long and healthy life with his wife, Norma; the
           pictures presenting a time line of sorts. No children, yet
           sheer, unadulterated happiness.


                                  Page 2/128
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

As John makes his way through his home, we can see that it is
cluttered and unorganized. Dirty, in fact, as if it hasn't
been cleaned in months.
                                                            2.



EXT. THE WICK HOME - CONTINUOUS

John opens the door, retrieves the newspaper, closes, and
locks the door behind him, without giving the outside so much
as a glance.



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

John unceremoniously tosses the newspaper onto the table,
opens a cupboard, and measures out a couple of tablespoons of
Folgers Coffee into an old percolator.

As it begins to bubble, John open the fridge, studies its
contents for a moment or two, and then closes it, abandoning
the thought of breakfast.

He pours himself a cup of coffee and sits at the table. The
newspaper is ignored. He drinks in silence for a long, dark,
brooding moment, the loneliness almost unsettling.

Suddenly, the phone on the wall RINGS.

John lowers his cup, staring at the device, his eyes tired.
A beat... and he stands, walking slowly to answer it.

                                          JOHN
          This is John.

As he listens to the voice on the other end, John remains
still... stoic.

                                             JOHN (CONT'D)
                                       (WHISPERS)


                          Page 3/128
                     Ok.

           John hangs up the phone and returns to the table, sinking
           slowly down into his chair.

           A long beat...

           ...and John begins to weep, his hands trembling as he lowers
           his face in excruciating, utter, and complete sorrow.



FADE TO:



           EXT. THE BARN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           Having shaved and showered, wearing an old -but well-fitted-
           gray suit, John pushes open the garage door...

           ...to reveal a legend in dire need of a total overhaul: a
           black, 1969 FORD MUSTANG `BOSS 429'.
                                                                        3.



           A smile plays at his lips as John walks into the garage,
           running a hand along the chassis, desperately in need of a
           wash and wax. Behind him, the wall is lined with tools: a
           mechanic's dream enclave.

                            JOHN ENTERS-



           INT. JOHN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           -and closes the door behind him.

           John takes a moment to breath it in: he loves this car...
           although he hasn't taken very good care of it as of late. A
           beat... and he slips the key into the ignition, twisting it,
           the motor coughing to life, the exhaust pipe belching black
           smoke.



           EXT. THE WICK HOME - CONTINUOUS


                                    Page 4/128
The vehicle pulls out of the garage, stalls briefly, come
back to life, puttering on down the road.



EXT. THE HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING - DAY

A soft rain begins to fall.



INT. THE HOSPITAL - A HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Carrying a humble bouquet of yellow daisies, John slowly
makes his way down the eerily empty corridor. He pauses
before a picture on the wall, glancing at his reflection upon
the glass. He takes a deep breath, exhales, and enters a
room.



INT. THE HOSPITAL - A ROOM - CONTINUOUS

John slowly approaches the figure lying in bed: surrounded by
machinery, accompanied by the soft sounds of technology.

He removes the wilted daisies from the vase, tosses them in
the trash, and replaces them with fresh ones.

He pulls over a chair, reaches out, and takes Norma's hand:
she is comatose, her breathing synthetic... so many
machines... so many wires, tubes, and monitors.

We never see her face:     just her silhouette.

He holds her hand for a long moment in heavy silence.
                                                              4.



Behind him, the DOCTOR -of a similar age to John- enters,
placing a hand on John's shoulder. John lowers his head, and
nods. With a bit of effort, he stands, staring down at her
for a long moment, never once releasing his grip, and leans
over to kiss her on the forehead.

                                      JOHN


                         Page 5/128
                     ...it had to be you...
                         (a long beat, then)
                     ...be seein' ya'...

           A beat... and John nods.

           The doctor turns off the machine; lights dim, the room
           settles into silence, and Norma's body grows still.

           The Doctor leaves John to be alone with his wife.

                                                JOHN (CONT'D)
                                          (WHISPERS)
                     Be seein' you.



FADE TO:



           EXT. THE BARN - DAY

           John pulls into the building...

           ...and sits behind the wheel for a long moment...

           ...his eyes unblinking...

           ...so very alone...



           INT. THE WICK HOME - THE HALLWAY - DAY

           John stands before the wall of pictures, statuesque as he
           studies them... unmoving...

           And then, he snaps; his hands gnarled into first, roaring
           with rage as he punches the pictures, ripping them from the
           wall, tossing them aside, eventually collapsing into a heap,
           out of breath, his knuckles bleeding.

           A long beat... and he chuckles softly, pulling himself to his
           feet.
                                                                       5.

INT. THE WICK HOME - THE BASEMENT - DAY

Unlike the rest of the house, this space is pristine and
organized: one half designated as an impressive wood shop,
the other an office space with a lazy boy recliner and tube
television.

John sits at his desk with a pencil in hand, a pad of paper
before him, thinking.

A long beat... and he sighs with a smile, placing the pencil
upon the pad before sliding them both aside.

John unscrews the cap off the bottle of scotch and pours
himself a healthy dose.

He opens his desk drawer, reaches into the back, and finds an
old pack of cigarettes, half-empty. He taps one from, places
it between his lips, and lights it, taking a deep pull. He
holds it, and exhales, his body relaxing.

He finishes his drink along with the cigarette, pours himself
another...

...and then opens a BOTTLE OF PILLS (The label reading NORMA
WICK and OXYCONTIN), pouring them into a small mound upon the
desk. He stares at them for a long moment...

...before selecting one, studying it, sighing and-

A KNOCK AT THE FRONT DOOR.

John freezes, not sure as to how best to proceed.

A beat... and someone KNOCKS a second time.

John sighs, drops the pill back onto the mound, and walks
upstairs.



EXT. THE WICK HOME - DAY

A DELIVERY WOMAN waits for him on the doorstep.     John opens


                       Page 7/128
the door.

                                            DELIVERY WOMAN
            John Wick?

                                            JOHN
            Yes?

She hands him a clipboard and a pen.
                                                             6.



                                         DELIVERY WOMAN
            Sign here, please.

In a daze, John signs the clipboard and hands it back to her.

                      DELIVERY WOMAN (CONT'D)
            And the pen?

                                          JOHN
            Oh.    Sorry.

John hands her the pen.

                                         DELIVERY WOMAN
            Here you go!

The Delivery Woman hands him a card and a PLASTIC CASE by the
handle which he takes without looking.

                      DELIVERY WOMAN (CONT'D)
            Have a good day.

John nods, and -as she takes off- heads back inside.



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

John closing the door behind him...

...and is startled by a small BARK.

A beat... and he looks down to find that he is actually


                            Page 8/128
holding a small PET CARRIER. He lifts it to look inside:
the face of a young, tri-colored (black, white, and brown),
CHORGI (half-Corgi, half-Chihuahua) looks out at him, her
tail wagging fiercely.

She barks again, and John lowers it, confused.



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - DAY

Holding the envelope in his hands, John sits across from the
carrier which he has set upon the table. Inside, the Chorgi
lies with paws crossed, studying him, tilting her head from
side to side.

A beat... and John opens the letter. The card inside is
simple; white with a single DAISY drawn upon it. John smiles,
instantly knowing who it is from, running a thumb along the
face of the flower. He hesitates, but opens the card.
                                                         7.



                    NORMA (V.O.)
          Dear, John. If you have received
          this, then I have not survived the
          surgery.
              (a beat, then)
          I am so, so sorry.

Tears begin to well in John's eyes.

                    NORMA (V.O.)
          But you've still got a life ahead
          of you, and I intend for you to
          live it. You may think you've
          hidden things from me, but you
          haven't. I know you. And should
          this reach you in time -which I
          pray it has- I beg you, I implore
          you, to stop. To think. To live.
              (a beat, then)
          I love you, John. With all my
          heart. Our years were good. The
          best, in fact. But I'd rather see


                       Page 9/128
                     you later... than sooner... your
                     best friend... Norma.

           John lowers the letter, wipes the tears from his cheeks, and
           stares at the puppy... chuckling.

                                                   JOHN
                     Well played, Norma.

           John reaches across, and flicks open the pet carrier.

                                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                                            (MUTTERS)
                     Well played.

           The Chorgi scrambles out of the cage and studies him;
           sniffing, licking, and barking.

                                                   JOHN (CONT'D)
                     So... you gotta' name?

           John checks the collar to find a DAISY-SHAPED medallion which
                          READS-

                                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                     Moose.
                         (a beat, then)
                     Seriously?

           As if in reply, Moose barks.
                                                                    8.



                                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                      All right, then...
                                              (SMILES)
                      ...Moose, it is.

The homestead has been completely overhauled with a new roof

INT. THE WICK HOME - THE MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The alarm sounds, followed by silence when a heavy hand drops
down upon the snooze button.

THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.

Silence.

THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.

Silence.

THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.

A beat... and John sighs, pulls back the covers, and kicks
out his legs, sitting on the edge of the bed, rubbing his
eyes.

THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.

John glances over at MOOSE who lies on the bed, her paws
crossed, held tilted, and tail excitedly wagging in notes of
three.

                                       JOHN
                                 (GROWLS)
           I'm up, I'm up.

THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.

               BEGIN MONTAGE

- John fries up a couple of pieces of bacon and adds them to
his plate of scrambled eggs and toast.
                                                           9.


                       Page 11/128
He kneels down next to Moose's bowl and pours some of the
bacon grease over the kibble. As John takes his seat at the
table to enjoy his coffee, breakfast, and newspaper, Moose
devours her meal.

- With his car tilted up by jack stands, John lays upon a
creeper cart beneath it, changing the oil as -nearby- Moose
lies in the sun, fast asleep. The vehicle is pristine: fully
restored and lovingly detailed. Finishing up, John slides
out from beneath the vehicle, and wipes the grease from his
hands with a shop towel.

                                     JOHN (CONT'D)
          That oughta' do it.
                               (TO MOOSE)
          Wanna' try it out?

THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.

- At an abandoned airfield, the Mustang roars down the open
stretch of landing strip as Moose stands at the open window,
tongue wagging in the air. John is in his element: calm,
cool, and collected behind the wheel of his car... almost as
if it is a natural extension of himself. He deftly shifts
gears, reaching speeds in excess of 120 miles per hour before
hitting a long patch of gravel, shifting, spinning the wheel,
and skidding -while remaining in full control- as the wheels
skim over the earth. Moose barks. John smiles, reaching
over to scratch her on the back.

                                   JOHN (CONT'D)
          Good girl, Moose. Good girl.

- At a small park, John sits at a picnic table, eating a
sandwich as he works his way through a small book of
crossword puzzles. A cup of hot coffee rests nearby as
beneath the table, Moose gnaws on a tough piece of rawhide.

-At a gas station, Moose barks at passing bikers as John
fills the tank.

IOSEF TARASOV -mid-twenties, thin, oiled hair, sunglasses,

hipster, douche-bag- parks his vintage BMW next to the Ford
and as he gasses up, motions.

                                       IOSEF
          Nice ride.

                                       JOHN
          Thanks.

                                       IOSEF
          How much?
                                                           10.



                                     JOHN
           It ain't for sale, kid.

Iosef smirks with a shake of his head.

                                    IOSEF
               (in Russian, subtitled)
           Everything's got a fucking price.

                                    JOHN
               (in Russian, subtitled)
           Maybe so... but I don't.

Taken aback by John's fluency, he watches as John enters the
vehicle, guns the engine, and drives off.

- John dozes on the couch as -between his legs- Moose snores
softly.

- As John washes his car, Moose chases after birds before -
exhausted- laying upon her back in the sun, stretching as she
gnaws upon her favorite stuffed animal.

- With a glass of scotch resting on the end table beside him,
John sits in his weathered La-z-boy recliner with his reading
glasses on, a book before him, and Moose curled up, asleep in
his lap. A beat... and John closes his book, finishes his
               SCOTCH-

                                     JOHN (CONT'D)

           Come on, then.

-and stands, with Moose leaping to the floor, leading the way
back upstairs.

- Moose lays on the foot of the bed, tail wagging.          John
smiles, scratching her belly.

                                         JOHN (CONT'D)
           Good night, Moose.

John climbs beneath the covers, sighs, and slips off to sleep
as does Moose.

INT. THE WICK HOME - THE MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

John awakes to hear Moose growling with tail thumping,
sitting before the closed door.

                                        JOHN
          Do you need to go out?

John groans as he rolls out of bed.

                                   JOHN (CONT'D)

John opens the door.       Moose barks, and sprints off into the
darkness.

                                        JOHN (CONT'D)
          What's gotten into y-

We hear a THUMP and a YELP.

          Moose!

John runs into-



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

-and freezes at the sight of two MASKED MEN...

...a half-second before a THIRD MAN steps into frame and
drives the butt of his shotgun against the side of John's
head. He drops to the floor, hard.

               JOHN'S POV:

Across the room, the silhouette of Moose's body faces him,
her breathing labored.

                    VOICE #1 (O.C.)
              (in Russian, subtitled)
          You find the keys?

One of the masked men, LIMPS by, dragging his foot slightly,
an old injury or birth defect.

                    VOICE #2 (O.C.)
              (in Russian, subtitled)
          Yeah. He kept `em in a bowl like
          my old man.

Voice #1 chuckles enjoying this as he sucks on a fresh mint.
                                                          12.



                      VOICE #1 (O.C.)
                (in Russian, subtitled)
            Then shit... let the fuckin'
            babushka fade away and let's get
            the fuck outta' here.

One of the men kneels down next to John, pulling back his
mask to reveal his mouth which grins upon him with white
lacquered teeth: it is IOSEF.

                         old man.
                                            (CHUCKLES)
                         I enjoyed this.

           Iosef cold cocks John as we-

           A small tail rises slowly, and lands with a soft "thump".

           John stirs with a groan, and opens his eyes...

           ...to find Moose's nose touching his cheek.

           He suddenly sits up, remembering.

                                                     JOHN
                         ...Moose...




                                       Page 16/128
           Moose takes a shallow breath...

           ...thump...
                                                                         13.



           John begins to unravel, hands trembling.

                                                         JOHN (CONT'D)

                         Moose...

           He touches Moose's side, and she whimpers.

           John recoils...

           ...and sees the trail of blood from where she was first
           injured...

           ...having pulled her broken body over to his side.

           John lies down beside Moose, and softly... tenderly...
           cradles her head in his hand, rubbing her cheek with his
           thumb.

           Moose relaxes, licks his thumb, sighs one last time...

           ...and grows still.

           John pulls himself up into a sitting position, cradles
           Moose's still body...

           ...and begins to cry...

           ...rocking back and forth.

John remains sitting on the floor with Moose in his arms.

A long beat... and he stands; an old, weary, and defeated
soul.



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

John flicks on the light and walks down the stairs, gently
placing Moose's body upon his work bench. He searches a
shelf and finds a large box which he unfolds...

...placing Moose's body within.

A beat...
                                                             14.



...and John reaches down to retrieve Moose's stuffed animal
from the floor, placing it down beside her.

With a tender -careful- touch, John removes Moose's collar,
placing it -almost with reverence- upon a nail in the wall.

John stares down at his dog for a long moment...

...before closing the box.



EXT. THE WICK HOME - THE BACK YARD - EARLY DAY

John digs a small grave...

...places the box, staring at it for a long moment...

...and then fills the hole.



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - EARLY DAY

On his hands and knees, John brushes the blood from the
floor.




                       Page 18/128
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE BATHROOM - EARLY DAY

John takes a long, hot shower.

He sprays a bit of shaving foam into his hand, unfolds his
ceramic razor, stares at it for a long moment...

...and begins to shave.

As he does so, the stress leaves his shoulders, his eyes
unblinking, his movements precise.

With every flick of his wrist, John seems to change slightly:
his features hardening, relaxed, and yet wound tight



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE MASTER BEDROOM - EARLY DAY

John gets dressed, but the outfit is slightly different than
we are used to seeing: dark, tailored pants, crisp white
shirt, Italian shoes, and a black, leather jacket.

The look suits him although it is a tad bit unsettling,
making for an intimidating veneer.
                                                             15.



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - EARLY DAY

John sips coffee -no breakfast- alone at the table, staring
at the wall.

Like clockwork, he lifts his mug, sips, lowers it, waits
patiently, lifts, sips, lowers...

...there are no micro-emotions, but it is anyone's guess what
is taking place in his mind.



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE HALLWAY - EARLY DAY

John leans heavy against the wall, staring at the pictures.
We now notice that among the images of John and Norma...


                          Page 19/128
           ...are also pictures of John and Moose.

           John lowers his head with a sigh, massaging his brow, lost in
           thought.

           When he raises his face...

           ...the change which has washed over him...

           ...is complete.

           INT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS

           A 24/7 chop shop, this facility is populated by dozens of
           hardened criminals, but has become the only family anyone


                                     Page 20/128
knows.

This is a tight knit, loyal, and talented crew.

A number of vehicles are being repaired, dismantled, painted,
and the like: a non-stop flurry of activity.

Walking the floor, AURELIO -late sixties, hard eyes, soft
smile, the father figure of this little family- banters with
his crew before pausing to help lower a new engine into a
car.



EXT. THE STREET - DAY

John's Mustang roars down the street, tires clawing at the
earth as it rounds a tight corner.



INT. THE MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS

Perched behind the wheel, IOSEF smiles as, in the passenger's
seat...

...VIKTOR -mid-twenties, short, stout, a pronounced LIMP,
well-dressed, gawdy jewelry, terrible glasses- and, in the
back seat...

...KIRILL -early thirties, enormous, muscular, meathead-
cheers him on.



EXT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS

The Mustang pulls into the lot, and enters-



INT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS

-pulling into an empty space.

A pair of OLDER MECHANICS notice the car, share an
emotionless -yet knowing- look, set down their tools, and
calmly leave the building.


                        Page 21/128
Iosef, Viktor, and Kirill pour out of the vehicle, laughing.

                                   IOSEF
              (in Russian, subtitled)

          I'ma gonna' keep this muthafucker!
              (to a mechanic)
          Hey, where's Aurelio at?

Iosef sees Aurelio walking towards him, his gaze locked onto
the Mustang, recognizing it.

                                     AURELIO
          Where'd you get that?

                                   IOSEF
          I gots my ways, yo! Now, it's hot

          I said, where... did you get that?

                               (SHRUGS)

                                     AURELIO
              (a beat, then)
          I know this car.

                                   IOSEF
          What the fuck are you sayin'?

Aurelio opens the driver's side door, reaches up behind the
visor, and pulls out the registration card which reads JOHN
WICK.




                       Page 22/128

Aurelio quickly replaces the card.

                                            IOSEF
          What?

                                            AURELIO
          Out.    Now.

                                   IOSEF
          What the fuck are you talking
          about?

By now, everyone in the facility has stopped working,
watching the drama unfold.
                                                          18.



                                   AURELIO
          I'm talkin' about you takin' this

          outta' my shop.

                                   IOSEF
          Did you lose your shit, Aurelio?
          We own you. You do what we say.

                                   AURELIO
          The fuck you do. Tell me...

Aurelio motions towards the car.

                                       AURELIO (CONT'D)
          ...did you kill him?

                                       IOSEF
          No.
                              (LAUGHS)
          But I sure as hell fucked up his
          dog.




                         Page 23/128
Aurelio's eyes grow wide... knowing.

Surprising even himself, Aurelio rears back and delivers a
powerful blow to the center of Iosef's face, shattering his
nose.

Stunned, Iosef reels and drops to a knee, cradling his face,
blood seeping between his fingers.

In a knee jerk reaction, Kirill pulls his gun.

The atmosphere immediately grows tense, the air still, as -
throughout the building- Aurelio's mechanics each reach for a
hidden weapon: knives, machetes, guns, and the like.

Aurelio glares -unblinking- at Kirill as he walks towards
him.

                                     AURELIO
          You pull a gun? On me?     In my
          house?

Aurelio presses his forehead against Kirill's outstretched
gun.

                                     AURELIO (CONT'D)
          Flick off the safety.

Kirill smirks, and flicks off the safety.
                                                               19.



                                        AURELIO (CONT'D)
             Pull back the hammer.

Kirill blinks, faltering in this game of brinkmanship.

                                        AURELIO (CONT'D)
             Now, either shoot me...
                 (shouts, angry)
             ...OR FUCK OFF!

Silence...




                       Page 24/128
       ...as Viktor lowers Kirill's arm and we can see he is
       relieved that Viktor intervened.

                                             VIKTOR
                    The old man ain't gonna' like this.

                                                     AURELIO
                    Maybe not.          But he'll understand.

       Viktor and Kirill help a still dazed Iosef to his feet.

                                             IOSEF

       The bus pulls away from the curb...

       ...and John crosses the street, making a b-line for Aurelio's
       automotive.



       INT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS

       John enters the building which is silent:            everyone is gone.

       John carefully makes his way through the floor, rounding a
       shelving array to find Aurelio -a cigarette dangling from
       between his lips- sitting at a folding card table, his hands
       folded in front of him, a bottle of Campari and two glasses
       resting nearby.

                                                  AURELIO
                    Hello, John.

                                                  JOHN
                    Hello, Aurelio.
                                                                   20.




                                 Page 25/128
Silence.

Aurelio flips over the glasses and pours two drinks.

                                        JOHN (CONT'D)
           Have you seen my car?

John takes a glass and slams back the drink, swallowed in a
single gulp.

                                    AURELIO
           I have, but it's not here.

                                        JOHN
           Where is it?

                                    AURELIO
           If I turn down the work, the
           Russians turn to Takeshi and his
           crew. You'll find them down on
           Third and Main.

                                           JOHN
           Thank you.

John turns to leave, but hesitates.

               (a long beat, then)
           Aurelio...

                                           AURELIO
           Yes, John?

                                        JOHN
           ...they killed my dog.

                                    AURELIO
           I know, John. I know... but
           "they"...
               (hesitating, then)
           ..."they" are extremely dangerous
           people.


                          Page 26/128
           John nods and walks from the room.

                                         (MUTTERS)
                      Aren't "they" always...

           A long beat, and Aurelio sighs, relaxing as he pours himself
           another drink.

           EXT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS

           A bus pulls up the curb, pauses for a beat, and then rolls
           off...

           ...leaving behind John who walks across the street, his
           expression blank.

           His gait is steady, his shoulders relaxed, hands limp at his
           sides, breath steady.

           The two GUARDS at the door glance up as he approaches,
           standing as they shift into character.

                                                   GUARD #1
                     What are you-

           Without slowing, John reaches into the man's jacket, slips
           free the pistol from the shoulder holster therein and-




                                     Page 27/128
THUMP! THUMP!

-fires -twice- into the man's heart, before turning-

THUMP!

- to fire once into the other guard's face, never slowing,
kicking open the door-



INT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS

-to enter the facility, shooting anything that moves. He is
the angel of death: each target receives two well-placed
bullets to ensure incapacitation. He never slows, never
misses, and will not stop.

The primarily Japanese crew is in a panic with most fleeing -
a number of whom are shot in the back- while those choosing
to shoot back are cut down in a blink.

Once emptied, John drops his pistol, kneels, sweeps up a
fallen gun up, levels, fires, always moving, and -as he
passes by a lift- slaps a button, slowly lowering his Mustang
down to the floor behind him.
                                                           22.



John is a force of nature as he clears out the building.

Unstoppable.



EXT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - THE REAR LOT - CONTINUOUS

A couple of mechanics escape the building, the last of which
is shot in the back; dropping to his knees as a bullet slams
into the back of his head.

Running with all of his might, MECHANIC #1 screams into his
phone.

                                     MECHANIC #1
                (in Japanese, subtitled)


                         Page 28/128
          I DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK HE IS!
          HE JUST SHOWED UP AND STARTED
          SHOOTING!

Behind him, John appears in the doorway, aims...

...and decides otherwise, lowering the pistol.



INT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS

John opens the door to the Mustang, tosses the pistol onto
the passenger's seat-



INT. THE MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS

-and slips behind the wheel. A slight smile plays upon his
lips as he sighs; a part of him having been returned. He
turns the key, revs the engine, slams his foot down on the
               GAS-



EXT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS

-and crashes through the garage door of the building, tires
squealing as the Mustang pulls a one-eighty, righting itself
               BEFORE-



EXT. A SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUOUS

-leaping out onto the street, furiously gaining momentum, as
a trio of heavily-modified NISSAN SKYLINES appear and take
chase.
                                                           23.



INT. THE MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS

John glances into the rearview mirror, takes the pistol in
his left hand, shifts, and spins the wheel-




                       Page 29/128
EXT. A SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUOUS

-turning to face the oncoming vehicles.



INT. THE MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS

John shifts again, and crushes the gas pedal underfoot-



EXT. A SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUOUS

-rear wheels smoking as they struggle to grip the road. Once
they do, however, the Mustang leaps forward, bearing down on
the Skylines.

As the distance between them grows smaller, the passengers of
two of the skylines emerge with semi-automatic weapons...

...but before either of them can fire...

...John fires off four shots, killing them each with a pair
of bullets...

...before firing until empty...

...killing two drivers, and one passenger...

...leaving one driver barrelling towards him, covered in his
passenger's blood, eyes wide with horror...

...as the two other cars crash behind him.

As the two vehicles barrel towards one another...

...John is stoic...

...while the remaining driver is screaming.

At the last moment, the driver violently twists the steering
               WHEEL-

-barely avoiding the Mustang-




                       Page 30/128
-but loses control of the vehicle, sending it toppling end
over end, cart-wheeling amidst a cloud of debris, before
landing upside down-
                                                          24.



-the gas tank having ruptured, fuel gurgling out of the tank
to pool around the crushed rooftop.



INT. A NISSAN SKYLINE - CONTINUOUS

The driver hangs from his seat, his belt keeping him in
place, stunned and bleeding from the forehead.

A beat...

...followed by the sound of footsteps.

As the driver shifts in his seat, a ZIPPO LIGHTER falls out
of his pocket, landing on the ceiling.

John kneels down beside him.

                                     JOHN
                (in Japanese, subtitled)
            Where can I find Iosef Tarasov?

                                     DRIVER
                (in Japanese, subtitled)
            I don't know.

A beat... and John reaches inside to retrieve the lighter.
He flips it open, and ignites a flame.

                                      DRIVER (CONT'D)
                (in Japanese, subtitled)
            Don't! Please! Iosef! His
            father! He owns a club in
            Manhattan! The Red Circle! The
            Red Circle!

A beat... and John closes the lighter and tosses it back into
the vehicle.


                       Page 31/128
                                     JOHN
                (in Japanese, subtitled)
            Thanks.

A long beat... and the driver sighs.

                                     DRIVER
                (in Japanese, subtitled)
            Fuck.



EXT. A SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUOUS

As John walks back towards his vehicle, we can hear the sound
of cop cars approaching...
                                                           25.



...as a police chopper soars past overhead.

John doesn't look up as he quickly removes the front and rear
license plates -both affixed with quick release clasps-
tosses them into the back seat, and-



INT. THE MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS

-slips behind the wheel. He twists, the key, revs the
engine, and bolts forward as behind him-



EXT. A SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUOUS

-a pair of police cars round the corner-

-and overhead, the helicopter banks, its sights set on the
Mustang.

BEGIN INTERCUTS BETWEEN INTERIORS AND EXTERIORS OF THE
               VEHICLES

John leads the cops further and further into the city...




                       Page 32/128
           ...with traffic growing heavier with every block...

           ...and yet John maintains his speed-

           -driving down narrow service alleys with reckless abandon-

           -and going against traffic, steering with an apt hand.

           Eventually, John creates enough mayhem to tie up the police
           on the ground-

           -leaving the helicopter overhead.

           On a long stretch of road, John reaches the vehicle's top
           speed, reaches down, flips open a hidden compartment, and
           presses a button for-

           -his NITROUS OXIDE SYSTEM-

           -which causes the engine to SCREAM, roaring down the road at
           an incredible speed-

           -distancing himself from the helicopter to eventually hide in
           an abandoned warehouse.

           He parks...

           ...and walks across the street to the local diner...
                                                                        26.



           ...as overhead, the police chopper searches in vain.

The floor is empty, the building quiet.



INT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - THE MAIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Sitting at his desk, Aurelio -a cigarette dangling from
between his lips- works on a model car, carefully gluing
pieces together.

The bottle of Campari rests nearby.       Music plays softly from
a radio nearby.

The phone rings.     Aurelio takes a deep breath, exhales, and
answers it.

                                      AURELIO
           This is Aurelio.

                     VIGGO (O.S.)
           I hear you've struck my son.

                                      AURELIO
               (deep breath, sighs)
           Yes, sir. I did.

                     VIGGO (O.S.)
           Might I ask why?

                                    AURELIO
           Because he stole John Wick's car.

Silence.

                                         VIGGO
                   (a long beat, then)
           Oh.

                                         AURELIO

           head.

           EXT. A TOWNHOUSE - ESTABLISHING - DAY



           SUPER:

           A resplendent home in one of the city's wealthiest
           neighborhoods.

           A trio of military-grade SEDANS -heavily armored,
           tinted/bulletproof glass, intimidating- pull up to the curb.
           The first and third empty as the keen eyes of ten gunmen
           scour the street, buildings, and rooftops.

           A beat... and one of them slaps a hand on the middle Sedan's
           roof.

           Preceded -and proceeded- by a gunman, IOSEF emerges;
           belligerently naive and yet... scared.



           INT. A TOWNHOUSE - THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

           Lighting himself a cigarette, VIGGO TARASOV -60s, face
           scarred by a hard life, one eye dead, hair perfectly coifed,
           expensive suit, a slight limp, relying on a cane- fills a
           tumbler with ice.




                                  Page 35/128
He selects a fresh bottle of JEWEL OF RUSSIAN CLASSIC VODKA
and twisting off the cap, hesitating. Deciding otherwise,
Viggo dumps out the ice, pours himself a double shot, and
slams it back...

...before refilling the glass with ice and pouring himself a
healthy dose.

                 IOSEF ENTERS-

                                    VIGGO
               (in Russian, subtitled)
           Close the door.
                                                       28.



-and closes the door behind him, tilting his chin towards his
father with a smirk.

                                          IOSEF
          Poor me a double, aye?

                                             VIGGO
                                       (SIGHS)
          Aye.

In a surprising blur of motion, Viggo spins-

-and drives a fist into Iosef's stomach with enough force to
lift him -momentarily- from the ground.

With the wind knocked out of him, Iosef drops to his knees,
opens his mouth to say something, but instead vomits, gagging
as he gasps for breath.

Viggo casually returns to the bar, grabs a towel, and tosses
it down onto his son.

                                   VIGGO (CONT'D)
              (in Russian, subtitled)
          Clean that up.

Again, Iosef opens his mouth to say something, but decides
otherwise. He grabs the towel and cleans up his mess.


                         Page 36/128
Viggo takes his drink and walks to the window, his cigarette
smoldering from the corner of his lips.

                                   VIGGO (CONT'D)
          You should know by now that I live
          by one simple rule...
              (in Russian, subtitled)
          Should a whelp snap at your
          fingers, you crush it's fucking
          skull.

Iosef pulls himself to his feet, and stumbles to the bar,
pouring himself a drink.

                                     IOSEF
              (hushed, pained)
          What'd I do?

                                   VIGGO
              (in Russian, subtitled)
          You fucked up.

                                     IOSEF
          I don't know what y-
                                                        29.



Viggo backhands him, the sound more painful than the strike.

                                      VIGGO
          Yes.   You do.

                                     IOSEF
              (hesitating, then)
          So I stole a fucking car!     So
          fucking what?

Viggo smiles -amused- finishes his drink...

...and drives a fist into Iosef's stomach again, dropping him
once more to his knees, tears rolling down his cheeks as he
vomits up his own drink.




                       Page 37/128
                                   VIGGO
          Use that tone with me again...

Viggo kneels down next to Iosef, grabs his hair, pulls back
his head, produces a switchblade, flicking open the blade and
placing it to the flesh directly beneath his son's right eye.

                                   VIGGO (CONT'D)
              (in Russian, subtitled)
          ...and I'll serve your eye to you
          in your martini.

Trembling, Iosef chokes back tears.

                                   VIGGO (CONT'D)
              (in Russian, subtitled)
          Am I understood?

                                     IOSEF
              (gulps, then)
          Yes... father.

A beat... and Viggo removes the blade from Iosef's cheek and
stands, folding the switchblade closed as he stands to pour
himself another drink.

                                   VIGGO
          It wasn't the "what you did",
          Iosef, which draws my ire, but "who
          you did it to".

                                     IOSEF
          What?
              (a beat, then)
          The old man?
                                                       30.



                                   VIGGO
          Careful, son... that old man
          happens to be three years younger
          than I.

Iosef lowers his eyes, his breath catching in the back of his


                       Page 38/128
throat.

                                     VIGGO (CONT'D)
          His name is John Wick...
              (smirks at the memory)
          ...and when he was fifteen, he lied
          his way into the marines and headed
          off to Vietnam. He specialized in
          force-oriented reconnaissance,
          meaning he often crossed over into
          enemy territory to both collect
          information and -should the
          opportunity present itself- fuck
          with the enemy in whatever way that
          he saw fit.

Wearing an undershirt and pants, sweating profusely, John
wields a SLEDGEHAMMER which he swings down onto the floor
time and time again, cracking the concrete foundation.

                    VIGGO(V.O.)
          John earned four hundred and
          seventeen confirmed kills over the
          course of his five tours. The
          majority of those were done by
          hand, by blade, and by small
          caliber... which is unheard of.

Viggo takes a long pull off of his drink as the information
sinks into Iosef, the blood draining from his face.

                                   VIGGO
          It got to him, though. Hell... How
          could it not? Even though he won
          every military distinction on

          -John was eventually discharged -
          with high honors, of course- and
          found himself in the city...

-which he swings open, revealing a ladder.

                    VIGGO (V.O.)
          ...lookin' for work.

John grabs a flashlight and heads down.

Viggo lowers his empty glass as Iosef refills his glass with
a trembling hand.

                                     IOSEF
              (hesitating, then)
          What kind of work?

                                   VIGGO
                             (GROWLS)

                    VIGGO (V.O.)
          John was the goddamned boogeyman;
          give him a name, request a method,
          and he'd get it done. Come hell or
          high water, by God... he'd get it
          done.

Viggo leans against the fireplace, suddenly tired.
                                                          32.



                                    VIGGO
          Then one day, he fell in love and
          left the game. The years scrolled
          past, age set in, and he -like
          myself- had to watch the love of
          his life die. Suddenly alone, with
          no family to speak of, John
          deserved to live -and die- in
          peace.
                             (GROWLS)
          Instead...

John selects a black case, unclasps it, and swings it open-

                     VIGGO (V.O.)
                              (GROWLS)
          You went and killed his fucking
          dog.

-to reveal a number of PISTOLS, SILENCERS, and AMMUNITION.

Iosef drops down into a chair, the comprehension of his

                                   VIGGO
          Until I say otherwise, you are
          under house arrest. Am I
          understood?

                                     IOSEF
                               (MUTTERS)
          Yes, sir.

Viggo turns to leave, chuckling softly to himself.

                                        VIGGO
          John Wick.     Good God...

He pauses at the door, glancing back at his son with a
crooked smile.

                                   VIGGO (CONT'D)
              (in Russian, subtitled)

INT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

John sits at the kitchen table, having cleaned and assembled
one pistol, now oiling a second. His hands are steady, his
skill impressive.

We slowly move past him, over the counter, to the door whose
handle softly turns. We pull back as it opens-

-FOUR MEN in black masks, each armed with a silenced pistol
enter, fanning out-

-and yet John is nowhere to be seen...

...and two silenced pistols are missing from the table.

EXT. THE WICK HOME - CONTINUOUS

A COP CAR pulls up in front of the barn.



INT. A COP CAR - CONTINUOUS

Behind the wheel, CARLO -late twenties, a bit dim, but nice
enough- kills the engine.

                                     CARLO
          Let's see here...

Carlo checks the dashboard computer.

                                   CARLO (CONT'D)

Chuckling EDWARDO -58, nearing retirement, large, heavy,
smarter than he looks- takes a sip of coffee from his paper
cup before unbuckling his belt.

                                   EDWARDO
          Yeah, I'm thinkin' he's the one.

edwardo opens his door...

          Protocol's protocol. Stay put.
          I'll make this quick.
                                                       34.

The four masked men enter the living room, each wound tight,
their silenced weapons at the ready. The lead among them
enters the hallway-

-and is shot twice; once in the chest, and once in the head.
As he goes down, John moves past, killing two others, leaving
the remaining gunmen-



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

-cowering in the kitchen, leaning against the wall.



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               JOHN AIMS-

-the kitchen light casting the gunman's shadow-

-and fires twice into the wall-



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

-hitting the gunman in the back and the head, dropping him to
the floor.



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

John lowers the pistol, walks to the door, and peers through
the keyhole to see Edwardo standing on his porch. A beat...
and John slips the pistol in the back of his pants, unlocks,
and opens the door.

An awkward pause, then-

                                        EDWARDO
             Evenin', John.

                                        JOHN
             Evenin', Ed.

                                        EDWARDO
             You workin' again?
                                                        35.



John follows his gaze...

...to see that a dead gunman is in Edwardo's direct line of
sight.

                                   JOHN
          No...just sorting out a few things
          with the Russian mob.

                                   EDWARDO
          Ah. Well, then... sort that out
          however you see fit. I'll cover
          your ass on my side of the fence as
          best I can.

                                   JOHN
          Thanks, Ed... but you still owe me.

                                     EDWARDO
          That, I do.
              (a beat, then)
          Good night, John.

                                     JOHN
          Good night, Ed.

Edwardo turns, takes a few steps, hesitates, and turns back.

                                   EDWARDO
          Earlier today, there was an
          incident involving a `69 Mustang-

                                     JOHN
          Yeah, that was me.

                                     EDWARDO


                       Page 45/128
          Oh. Well, then... I'd recommend
          you find yourself a new ride for
          the time being. The heat on that
          make ain't gonna' die down for
          quite some time.

Edwardo leaves.   John closes and locks the door behind him.



INT. A COP CAR - NIGHT

Edwardo slips into his seat, closing the door behind him.

                                       ROBERTO
          Well?
                                                            36.

          He ain't our fuckin' guy.
                             (MOTIONS)
          Who's next on the list?



INT. THE BARN - NIGHT

John pulls a large roll of plastic sheeting down from the
rafters, balancing it on his shoulder with a grunt.

He grabs a roll of duct tape as he exits.



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

John drops the plastic sheeting down upon the floor, and
rolls it out.

Standing over one of the gunmen, he reaches down, retrieves
the man's pistol, and slips it into the holster at the man's
side. John then kneels beside him and pushes the body onto
the plastic, rolling him up tight.

Using his ceramic straight razor, the plastic is cut off from


                         Page 46/128
the roll. Wrapping the feet, arms, and head tight with duct
tape, John repeats this process with each body...



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - LATER

...until they are neatly lined up near the back door.

John takes the phone off the wall, thinks for a long moment,
and dials a number.

A long beat, then...

                                   JOHN
          This is Wick. John Wick, that's
          right. Yeah, it has been awhile.
              (a beat, then)
          I'd like to make a reservation for
          four.

John glances at the bodies.

                                   JOHN (CONT'D)
          Ten o'clock? Perfect. Thanks.

John hangs up.
                                                        37.



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

John casually opens one of a half-dozen, identical, silver
cases stacked among the others.

Inside are hundreds of AMERICAN LIBERTY GOLD BULLION COINS.

John counts out SIX of them, and closes the case.



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

John mops up the blood...

...and spackles the bullet holes in his wall.


                       Page 47/128
We hear a KNOCK at the back door.

John wipes his hands against his pants, and-



INT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

-opens the door.

Removing his hat, CHARLIE -70s, small, creepy, thin, frail,
eyes gentle, a tattooed smirk upon his lips- extends his hand
with a smile.

                                      CHARLIE
          Good to see you, John.

John shakes his hand.

                                      JOHN
          You, too, Charlie.

Charlie enters, followed by two GOONS -forties, tall,
muscular, emotionless- who offer John little more than a nod
before they begin carrying the bodies out of the house.

                                   CHARLIE
          I was sorry to hear about Norma.

                                      JOHN
          Thanks.

                                    CHARLIE
          She was always kind to me.
              (a beat, then amused)
          So, what have you been doing to
          pass the time?
                                                       38.



                                      JOHN
          I got me a hobby or two.

                                       CHARLIE


                        Page 48/128
          I can see that.
                             (HESITATING)
          Tell me, John... are we back in the
          game, now?

                                     JOHN
          Sorry, Charlie, but no.       I'm on my
          own nowadays.

                                   CHARLIE
                             (SIGHS)
          That is a pity. I find the new
          breed of your ilk unstable, ill-
          wrought, and tiresome. The
          overused adage holds true: they
          don't make `em like they used to,
          John.

                                     JOHN
                               (SMILES)
          No, they don't.

                                     GOON #1
          We're a go, boss.

                                        CHARLIE
          Excellent.

John hands Charlie the six gold coins which he graciously
accepts with a slight tilt of the head.

                                        JOHN
          Thanks.

                                   CHARLIE
          My pleasure, John... and might I be
          expecting more such visitations?

                                   JOHN
          I make no promises on that.

                                      CHARLIE
                               (CHUCKLES)
          Well said.


                       Page 49/128
           Charlie extends his hand.         John shakes it.

                                                  CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                     Be seein' you, John.
                                                                     39.



                                                   JOHN
                      See ya', Charlie.

           John closes the door.

                     Good day, sir.

           -and walks on as Evan turns the x-ray machine back on,
           slipping the gold coins into his pocket.

           EXT. THE RAIL TRACKS - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           A silver-nosed train roars past, its wheels melting snow from

           the tracks beneath it.

           John sits alone, the train half-empty, staring out at the
           countryside passing him by.

           Small, trendy, and posh:        an upscale, boutique hotel.



           INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Carrying a bulky briefcase in each hand -with the duffel bag
           slung across his shoulders- John approaches the front desk
           where the MANAGER smiles up at him.

                                              MANAGER
                     Hello, sir. How may I help you
                     today?

                                                    JOHN
                     I called ahead.          Reservation for
                     John Wick.

           The Manager checks his computer.

                                               MANAGER
                     Ah, yes.   I have you for two
                     nights.


                                    Page 54/128
                                   JOHN
          Depending on business, it may be
          more.

                                   MANAGER
          That's not a problem, sir. We're
          only at sixty percent capacity.
                                   (MORE)
                                                       43.

                                   MANAGER (CONT'D)
          Just let me know should you choose
          to extend your stay.

                                   JOHN
                             (LOOKING AROUND)
          Y'know, I haven't been here in
          years. When did the old girl get a
          facelift?

                                      MANAGER
          About twelve years ago.

                                      JOHN
          Same owner?

                                         MANAGER
                                (NODS)
          Same owner.

John slides across a GOLD COIN...

                                      JOHN
          Is she still singin'?

...which the Manager -without so much as a blink- slides into
his pocket.

                                      MANAGER
          She is. Daily, in fact.      Round
          about midnight.

                                      JOHN


                        Page 55/128
                     That's good to hear.

           The Manager hands him a key.

                                                 MANAGER
                     Floor seven, room nine.
                                        (MOTIONS)
                     Would you like help with your bags?

                                                 JOHN
                     No, thanks.

                                              MANAGER
                     Will there be anything else then,
                     sir?

                                              JOHN
                         (glances at his watch)
                     Can you send me up a hamburger -
                     rare, mustard, onions, pickle- and
                     fries?
                                                           44.

                         (writing it down)
                     Yes, sir. And to drink?

                                              JOHN
                     A nice Pinot. Mid-range. I'll
                     leave that to your discretion.

                                              MANAGER
                     Yes, sir. I have one in mind.
                     It'll be up in a half-hour.

                                                    JOHN

The sun has begun to set;        the street lamps having begun to
ignite.



INT. JOHN'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A half-eaten meal is scattered upon the table, the bottle of
wine half-empty.

Resting upon the bed, the briefcases lie open, revealing a
veritable armory of dismantled weapons, numerous clips, and
boxes of ammunition.

Sitting at the desk, John pauses from cleaning a pistol to
empty the wine into his glass. Once done, he pulls back the
slide, studies the pistol with a keen eye, releases it,
carefully loads a clip with bullets, and slides it into the
pistol: locked and loaded.

From a small wooden case, John selects a SILENCER which he
screws onto the pistol. He sets it down next to a pump-
action sawed-off SHOTGUN, a SNIPER RIFLE, an old school UZI
SUBMACHINE GUN -silenced- with a polished mahogany stock, a K-
BAR DAGGER, and another pistol.

A beat... and John stands, slips the silenced pistol into the
back of his pants, dons his jacket, turns off the light, and
leaves.
                                                         45.



EXT. THE RED CIRCLE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

An upscale night club, the line curled around the side of the
building, generously serviced by heat lamps to accommodate
the almost non-existent dresses of the many young women.



EXT. THE RED CIRCLE - CONTINUOUS

John approaches the BOUNCER -30s, Russian, massive, tattooed
neck, intimidating, his suit one size too small on purpose-
who controls entry, the guest list glowing upon his tablet


                       Page 57/128
computer.

                                     BOUNCER
            Name?

John hands him three, hundred dollar bills.

                                     JOHN
            Guest.

The Bouncer takes the bills, pockets them, and unclips the
red velvet rope, allowing him entry.

                                     BOUNCER
            Welcome.

                                     JOHN
            Thanks.

As John enters, those in the front of the line complain but
are ignored as the rope is re-attached.



INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Strangely enough, the lobby is laid back and pleasant.

A single bar is available to the dozen or so patrons who
lounge about smoking, laughing, and talking as servers wander
the floor, offering a variety of appetizers.

Beyond the lobby, however, is a security station -replete
with a METAL DETECTOR- in front of the elevators: the
"action" it would seem, is on the top floor.

John approaches the security station and pauses, dropping to
a knee to tie his shoe...

...and remove his silenced pistol, shoving it deep into the
soil of a potted plant.
                                                         46.



John stands, empties his pockets into a small plastic bin,


                       Page 58/128
hands it to a guard, and walks through: he is clean.

                                       JOHN
          Thanks.

John takes his things, enters the elevator, and presses the
red "P" for penthouse.



INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE PENTHOUSE LOBBY - LATER

The doors to the elevator open, the music deafening.     John
exits, turns left, and enters-



INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE PENTHOUSE DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

-a two-story structure with the VIPs assembled up top; each
having paid for their private tables. John enters, carefully
studying the room. He approaches the bar and waves down a
bartender.

                                     BARTENDER
          What can I get you?

John motions upwards as he slides across five, hundred dollar
bills.

                                       JOHN
          A table.

The Bartender studies him... and then takes his money.

                                       BARTENDER
          This way.

John follows the Bartender...

...who slips a hundred dollar bill to each of the goons on
either side of the staircase, heads upstairs...



INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE PENTHOUSE - 2ND LEVEL - CONTINUOUS




                       Page 59/128
...and slips two bills to the Waitress-

                                  (TO JOHN)
          Enjoy.

-before returning to the bar.
                                                            47.



                                        WAITRESS
          This way, sir.

John follows the Waitress...

...to a table with a perfect view of both levels.

                                        WAITRESS (CONT'D)
          Will this do?

                                        JOHN
          Yes, thank you.

                                   WAITRESS
          What would you like to drink?

                                   JOHN
          Single Malt. Irish, if you've got
          it.

John slides her two more hundred dollar bills.

                                        JOHN (CONT'D)
          And start me up a tab.

                                   WAITRESS
          Yes, sir. I've got a ten-year
          Michael Collins.

                                   JOHN
          Perfect. Do you have a meat and
          cheese plate?

                                         WAITRESS


                          Page 60/128
                   I do.    Anything else?

                                                JOHN
                   No.     Thank you.

         As the Waitress turns to fill his order, John studies the
         floor...

         ...and the upper balcony... searching.



         EXT. THE RED CIRCLE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

         A soft snow begins to fall.



         INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE PENTHOUSE - 2ND LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

         John nibbles on some cheese and bread as he pours himself a
         generous helping of whiskey.
                                                                     48.



         Down below, Viktor -finishing off his drink- LIMPS past.

         John's eyes narrow.

         He finishes his drink, stands, and follows after Viktor,
         almost breathing down his neck.

         Book-ended by a pair of Estruscan bodyguards who follow every
         move he makes, Viktor slaps a waitress on the ass as he walks
         past.

                                            VIKTOR
                       (in Russian, subtitled)

         ...VIKTOR limps past.

                             VIKTOR (O.C.)
                       (in Russian, subtitled)
                   Yeah. He kept `em in a bowl like
                   my old man.



SMASHCUT TO:



         INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

         Drunk, Viktor and his bodyguards enter the bathroom, pausing
         to light a cigarette, before limping into-



         INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - A STALL - CONTINUOUS

         -where he leans against the wall in front of the toilet, eyes
         at half-mast.



         INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

         John enters as a patron leaves, the bathroom now empty save
         himself, Viktor, and the bodyguards.

         As the door closes, John produces his CERAMIC STRAIGHT RAZOR,
         drives it between the door and the jamb, and snaps it in two.
                                                                 49.



         INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE PENTHOUSE - 2ND LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

         A patron approaches the door and attempts to enter, but it
         won't budge. He shrugs and heads off in search of another
         bathroom.

                                 Page 62/128
One of the bodyguards turns as John approaches, his eyes
instantly wide -uncomprehending- as the broken tip of the
blade easily slices open his neck, splashing John with his
own hot blood.



INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - A STALL - CONTINUOUS

Viktor glances towards the closed door with a smirk.

                                     VIKTOR
          Hello?



INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

As the bodyguard drops to his knees -bleeding out- the second
guard produces a pistol and -as John moves into him- manages
to fire off a round which punches through John's shoulder.



INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - A STALL - CONTINUOUS

Viktor tenses -eyes wide- shakes off before zipping up his
pants, reaches into his jacket, and fumbles for his gun.



INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

With a cry derived far more from anger than pain, John head
butts the other bodyguard -shattering his nose, his face
instantly crimson with blood- before slashing the remnant of
the blade wide, severing the bodyguard's artery.

The door to the bathroom stall opens and as Viktor emerges
with pistol held out-

-John slaps it aside, breaks his arm and kicks in his leg-



INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - A STALL - CONTINUOUS

-sending him to his knees, screaming.
                                                         50.


                       Page 63/128
John grabs the broken arm, twists it behind Viktor's back,
drags him towards the towel, grabs him by the hair, and
shoves his face into the toilet. He holds him there for a
good amount of time...

...before ripping him back out.

Gasping for breath, Viktor's eyes are wide, sobriety having
swiftly returned.

                                     VIKTOR
                               (CHOKING)
          What the fuck d-

John answers by slamming his head against the rim of the
toilet -breaking Viktor's nose- before shoving his face back
beneath the water. A long beat...

...and John pulls Viktor back up for air.

                                   JOHN
              (in Russian, subtitled)
          My name is John Wick. You took my

          Fuck you, old m-

Behind his back, John snaps Viktor's wrist, and -as he drives
his face back beneath the water- John snaps one finger after
the next.

Underwater, Viktor screams, struggling.

John pulls him free.

                                   VIKTOR (CONT'D)
                             (WAILING)
          VIGGO! HIS FATHER! HE'S WITH
          VIGGO!

                                       JOHN
            And where is Viggo?

                                     VIKTOR
            He moves about... from one place to
            the next... he's put Iosef under
            his thumb... wherever Viggo goes,
            so does Iosef.

John twists Viktor's arm, breaking it with a dry SNAP.
Viktor screams...
                                                         51.



...but John keeps holding his arm painfully in place.

                                      JOHN
                 (in Russian, subtitled)
             Where... is... Viggo?

                 (in Russian, subtitled)
             Please... I don't know... please...

A beat...

...and John drives Viktor's head down upon the toilet rim at
an odd angle, his neck snapping.

Silence.

John removes Viktor's wallet and cellphone before exiting the
stall.



INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

He slides Viktor's wallet into one pocket and his cell phone
into another. At the sink, he turns on the cold water tap...

...splashes it up into his face, turns...

...and pauses, realizing that he is covered in blood.




                         Page 65/128
John pulls off his shirt, wipes the blood from his face,
tosses the shirt aside, reaches down, removes Viktor's shirt,
and slips it on, carefully buttoning it up.

He wets his hair, slicks it back, turns, removes the piece of
ceramic blade wedged in the door frame, tosses it into the
trash, and leaves.



INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE PENTHOUSE - 2ND LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

John passes by the Waitress, pausing to hand her a couple of
hundred dollar bills.

                                              JOHN
            Please close out my tab.

                                                 WAITRESS
            Yes, sir.
                                        (NODS)
            Thank you, sir.

The blood from his shoulder wound begins to seep into the
shirt, but only he notices it.
                                                            52.



                                            JOHN
          Good evening.

                                            WAITRESS
          Good evening, sir.

John heads down the staircase-



INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

-and calmly makes his way through the sea of dancers...

...as up top, chaos erupts but is silenced by the deafening
music.




                          Page 66/128
INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Using his one good shoulder, John opens the steel door, and -
his skin pale, cold sweat upon his brow- moves as fast as he
can downwards.

His shoulder hurts.

The blood loss nears critical.



EXT. THE RED CIRCLE - AN ALLEY - NIGHT

John exits the building as he scrolls through Viktor's phone,
searching.

He finds Iosef's number, and as he calls it, studies the
image of Iosef which appears on screen.



EXT. VIGGO'S TOWNHOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT



INT. VIGGO'S TOWNHOUSE - A BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Iosef lays on his bed with an arm behind his head, smoking as
he stares up at the ceiling.

We hear the vibration of his cell phone. He lifts the phone,
smiles at the sight of Viktor's caller I.D., and answers.

                                   IOSEF
              (in Russian, subtitled)
          Hey, Vik.
                                                        53.



                    JOHN (O.S.)
              (a long beat, then)
          Viktor is dead.

Iosef bolts upright, his breath stuck in his throat, eyes
wide.




                       Page 67/128
INT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

John trudges through the snow with Viktor's phone to his ear.

                                   JOHN
          As for the car, I got that back,
          but as for Moose, well... I'm
          takin' a page from Exodus on that
          one: an eye for an eye.
              (a beat, then)
          No... no, better yet, Genesis.



INT. VIGGO'S TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Iosef swallows hard.

                    JOHN (O.S.)
          Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;
          Wives of Lamech, listen to my
          speech. For I have killed a man
          for wounding me, even a young man
          for hurting me. If Cain shall be
          avenged sevenfold, then Lamech
          seventy-sevenfold.



INT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

John peers around the corner.

                                   JOHN
          Make your peace with God, Iosef...
              (in Russian, subtitled)
          ...for the Devil shall see you
          soon.



INT. VIGGO'S TOWNHOUSE - A BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

A long beat... and Iosef hangs up his phone, staring at the
wall... a solitary tear rolling down his cheek.
                                                         54.

           EXT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           John tosses the phone down into the snow, and jogs across the
           street...

           ...as MARCUS -a cigarette smoldering between his lips-
           watches him from the shadows.

           INT. THE CONTINENTAL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT



           INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           The lobby is empty -save the Manager- who glances up from his
           computer...

           ...to find a wounded -and quite bloody- John walking towards
           him.

                                                MANAGER
                                          (WITHOUT BLINKING)
                     Good evenin', sir.

                                                JOHN
                     Evenin'.    Is the doctor in?

                                                MANAGER
                     Yes, sir.    Twenty-four/seven.

                                                JOHN
                     Send him up, please.

                                                MANAGER
                     Yes, sir.    Anything else, sir?

                                                JOHN
                     Depends.    How good's your laundry?




                                  Page 69/128
                                   MANAGER
          The best, sir, however, I'm sorry
          to say that...
              (hesitating, then)
          ...no one's that good.

John chuckles, sliding a gold coin across to the Manager.

                                             JOHN
          No, I thought not.
                             (NODS)
          Send me up a beer, too, will you?
                                                         55.



                                     MANAGER
          Yes, sir.    What do you favor?

                                            JOHN
          Anything cold.



EXT. THE CONTINENTAL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT



INT. JOHN'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sitting in a chair with his shirt off and a beer in hand,
John grits his teeth as the DOCTOR -80s, steady hands,
glasses, thinning hair, frail, but strong- removes the bullet
from his shoulder, dropping it into a glass of water.

                                            JOHN
          Did she chip off?

                                            DOCTOR
          Lucky for you, no.            It looks to be
          a sub-sonic.

                                            JOHN
          Good to hear.

The Doctor cleans the wound, dries it off, and begins to sew
shut the wound.


                          Page 70/128
INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE HALLWAY - LATER

The Doctor exits as John stands in the doorway, his shoulder
bound tight with gauze.

                                   JOHN
          What sort of movement am I lookin'
          at?

                                   DOCTOR
          If you're lookin' to heal right
          quick, then keep it marginal.
          However, if you've still...
              (searching, then)
          ...got a bit a' business to attend
          to...

The Doctor hands him a pill container.

                                   DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          ...take two of these beforehand.
          You will rip open, you will bleed,
          but you will have full function.
                                                          56.



                                            JOHN
          And after?

                                   DOCTOR
          It'll hurt like hell, son... but
          come the long run, you'll be fine.

John hands the Doctor two gold coins.

                                       JOHN
          Thanks, doc.

                                          DOCTOR
          It's what I do.
                                 (NODS)
          Evenin', John.

                                                 JOHN
                       Evenin'.

           John closes the door behind him.



FADE TO:



           EXT. THE CONTINENTAL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           The snow now falls harder, although the pace seems lazy.



           INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Dressed in a fresh suit and tie, John strides through the
           kitchen, ignored by the bustling staff.



           INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE KITCHEN - DRY STORAGE - CONTINUOUS

           John enters the room, and makes his way to the back where a
           small staircase leads downward.

           John walks down them and enters-



           INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           -walking down the long, brick-enclosed corridor...

           ...stopping before a large, thick, imposing IRON DOOR.

           John removes a gold coin from his pocket...

           ...and slips it into a slit -similar to that of a pay phone-
           to the right of the door.
                                                                   57.



           A beat...




                                  Page 72/128
...and a section of the door slides open, revealing a pair of
judging eyes. This is EDDIE -30s, red beard, shaven head,
pierced, tattooed, three piece suit- intimidating as hell.

He studies John for a long moment.

                                      EDDIE
                (a beat, then)
            I don't know you.

                                     JOHN
            Maybe not... but I know this place.

A beat... and Eddie slides the view piece shut.

A beat... and the door is unlocked, swinging open.

John enters, and the door is immediately swung shut behind,
sealed and locked tight.



INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE SPEAK EASY - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

The room is small, but comfortable.

To the right are a number of coat/hat racks populated by a
dozen or so items.

To the left is a bank of modified cigar locker; dozens of
transparent, safety-deposit boxes framed in mahogany with a
plaque -etched with a name- upon each.

Eddie hands the coin back to John.

                                      EDDIE
            You carryin'?

                                       JOHN
            No.   Wait...

John snaps back his wrist...

...and hands Eddie the ceramic straight blade.




                       Page 73/128
                                              JOHN (CONT'D)
            Sorry.

                                         EDDIE
            You gotta' name?

                                              JOHN
            John Wick.
                                                              58.



Eddie recognizes this name, his demeanor changing
drastically.

                                       EDDIE
          Oh.

Eddie turns, finds a locker with the name JOHN WICK carved
upon it, opens the small door, slides in the blade, and
closes it.

                                       JOHN
          How about you?

                                       EDDIE
          What about me?

                                       JOHN
          You gotta' name?

A beat... and Eddie smiles, extending a hand, instantly warm.

                                       EDDIE
          They call me Eddie.

                                   JOHN
                             (SMILES)
          Pleased to meet you, Eddie.

                                   EDDIE
          Same goes for me, Mr. Wick.

                                       JOHN
          Please... call me, John.

INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE SPEAK EASY - NIGHT

John enters the room through a pair of velvet drapes...

...and pauses, taking it all in with a smile.

A luxurious tavern crafted from a long forgotten speak-easy,
the room isn't too big, and isn't too small, but... just
right.

Booths line the outside walls while a number of tables are
scattered about.

Near the stage, a small dance floor has been cleared, the
wooden tiles worn, but lovingly cared for.
                                                        59.



On stage, JENNY -80s, African-American, petite, a commanding
presence- sways behind the microphone, singing an old
standard, her voice similar to that of Billie Holiday;
strong, tender, and sincere.

Her eyes grow wide at the sight of John, but she never wavers
from her tune.

As John makes his way through the room, everyone nodes,
offers a handshake, or a simple greeting: this is an old
family... of a sort.

In the corner, WINSTON -70s, English, tall, lean, well-
dressed, glasses, tailored, precise- sits with a worn,
paperback copy of THE TELL-TALE SHREW in one hand and a dry
sherry in the other.

                                     JOHN
          Hello, Winston.

Winston lowers the book, and glances across at John with a
blank -yet warm- look.

                                     WINSTON


                       Page 75/128
          Hello, Jonathan.
              (a beat, then)
          It's been awhile.

                                        JOHN
          That, it has.
                             (LOOKING AROUND)
          I'm glad to see the old place still
          up and runnin'.

                                   WINSTON
                             (HALF-SMILES)
          I could say the same for you.

John approaches the bar...

...where JIMMY -40s, African-American, three-piece suit,
expensive watch, kind eyes, quick to smile- looks up with a
grin.

                                        JIMMY
          Ho... lee... shit.

                                        JOHN
          Hey, Jimmy.

The two shake hands like old friends.

                                   JIMMY
          John, my God, it's been... what?
                                                       60.



                                   JOHN
          I'm no good with time, but... it's
          been awhile.

                                        JIMMY
          That, it has.
              (a beat, then)
          We we're all broken up over Norma,
          y'know.

                                         JOHN


                          Page 76/128
          She got the card, the flowers...
          she knows you -all of you- loved
          her.
               (a beat, then)
          And thanks, Jimmy. It meant a lot
          to me as well.

                                    JIMMY
          Well, shit, it's good to see you,
          John. What can I get you?

                                     JOHN
          I'd love a martini.

                                     JIMMY
          Gin, dry, and onions?

                                       JOHN
          Good man.

                                     JIMMY
          Go on and take a seat.      I'll be
          with you in a moment.

                                     JOHN
          Thanks, Jimmy.

                                   JIMMY
          All good, John... and seriously...
          it's good to see you.

As John leaves Jimmy to make his martini, John strays towards
the stage.

Jenny finishes her song, the audiences politely applauds, and
she steps down to give him a strong embrace.

                                   JENNY
          John Wick in the flesh... my, oh,
          my... will wonders never cease.

John smiles... almost sheepishly.
                                                          61.

                                       JOHN
          Hey, Jenny.

                                   JENNY
          Where've you been keepin' yourself?

                                   JOHN
          I'm not quite sure, but with that
          said... here I am.

                                       JENNY
          Here you are, indeed.       My, oh,
          my...

Jenny hesitates, and then clasps a hand to his shoulder.

                                   JENNY (CONT'D)
          I miss her, too, y'know...

                                          JOHN
          I know.

                                   JENNY
          And I haven't... I mean, not since
          the last time...
              (hesitating, then)
          Would you mind... if I sang it?
                             (SMILES)
          You can say, "no".

                                   JOHN
                             (CHUCKLES)
          No, no, Jenny... go right ahead.
          In fact... please do. I'd like to
          hear it, too.

                                          JENNY
          Will do.

Jenny hugs him again, kissing him on the cheek.

                                   JENNY (CONT'D)
          This visit of yours ain't no


                        Page 78/128
          passin' fancy, is it?

                                        JOHN
          No, ma'am.

                                   JENNY
          Well, then... you be safe, you
          hear?
                                                        62.



                                     JOHN
              (nods, smiles)
          I hear.

Jenny takes to the stage...

...as John sinks into his booth.

               JIMMY NODS-

                                       JIMMY
          Enjoy.

-as he slides a martini across to John.

On stage, Jenny whispers to the members of her small band
before taking to the microphone.

                                   JENNY
          It's been awhile, but... here's to
          the past... may it influence our
          future.

The music begins...

...and Jenny sings IT HAD TO BE YOU.

Her rendition is powerful, sweet, endearing, passionate, and
sincere. As John watches her sing, a smile tugs at the corner
of his lips.

On the empty dance floor...




                       Page 79/128
         ...John watches a younger version of himself with Norma...

         ...dancing slowly... twirling... her head on his shoulder...

         ...smiling...

         ...with a sigh...

         ...before disappearing.

         John swallows -hard- as a trembling hand wipes away a tear.

         Jenny smiles at him with a nod.

         He returns the gesture.

         She continues to sing.

         John raises his glass as-

63.



         -SNAP.   SNAP.    SNAP.     SNAP.       SNAP.



      CUT TO:



                          A CELLPHONE

         Five pictures of John are inconspicuously taken...

         ...by DAVID PERKINS -late twenties, cocky, expensive tastes,
         lean, cruel- at a table across the way.

         David sends them with a text:            "Is this him?"

         A beat... and he receives a text in return:               "Yes.   Where
are
         you?"

         David texts back:    "The Continental."




                                   Page 80/128
      A beat... and he receives a text:        "We may not engage in
      hostilities upon those premises."

      David texts back:   "I'm willing to take the risk."

      A beat... and he receives a follow up text: "Take him alive.
      Should you fail, we disavow. Should you succeed, we
      reward... greatly."

      David smiles...



   CUT TO:

      ...as does John.

      Once the song is done, Jenny is met with boisterous
      applause...

      ...with John clapping the hardest among them.



FADE TO:



      INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Exhausted -and more than a bit tipsy- John runs a hand along
      the wall to maintain his balance.

      He sings under his breath... humming the tune to IT HAD TO BE
      YOU.

      At his door, he fumbles with his key card, but finally
      manages to open it.
                                                                     64.



      INT. JOHN'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      John closes and locks the door behind him.      He sheds his
      jacket, his shoes, and his pants...

      ...flicks off the lights...


                             Page 81/128
           ...and crawls beneath the blankets with a sigh.



FADE TO:



           EXT. THE CONTINENTAL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           The snowstorm ends, the city suddenly still.



           INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Empty.

           A long beat... and two figures appear at one end of the hall
           while three appear at the other end: suits, ties, gloves,
           and masks.

           One of them inserts a key card attached to his cell-phone and
           hacks the lock; the light turning from red to green.

           Another places a small, MAGNETIC GUN to the door, adjusts the
           setting, and pulls the trigger-



           INT. JOHN'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -causing the latch to leap back from the door...

           ...which opens.

           All five men enter, closing the door behind them.

           Sound asleep, John lays upon his back beneath the covers,
           snoring softly.

           Well-rehearsed, two men focus upon his legs while two focus
           upon his arms, their hands hovering above an appendage as
           they wait for the fifth (DAVID)...

           ...who produces a plastic baggie, inside of which rests a
           damp TOWEL.


                                  Page 82/128
David removes the towel...

...counts down with a nod from 3... 2... 1...
                                                        65.



Like a well-oiled machine, hands clasp down upon John's arms
and legs as David slaps the rag down upon John's mouth.

John's body tenses as his eyes snap open...

...but he does not inhale.

A beat... and John twists at an odd angle, causing one of the
men holding his arm to lose his grasp. With his one arm
free, John reaches up, grabs David's wrist, and snaps it.

As David stumbles backwards with a cry, the others pounce
upon John...

...who produces the K-BAR blade from beneath the blankets,
driving it into the side of one man's neck once... twice...
three times...

...before releasing the blade, arching his back, and wrapping
his legs around another man's neck, tensing until -SNAP- the
man's neck breaks.

The remaining three -horrified- are at a loss; far removed
from their element.

David and a gunman run for the door as a third steps back,
removes his silenced pistol from a shoulder holster, and
blindly fires.

The bullets etch up along the mattress and into the
headboard...

...as John rolls off the bed, reaches beneath it, and grabs
the shotgun.

BOOM!




                       Page 83/128
The gunman's left leg disappears as -screaming- he sinks to
the ground.

BOOM!

John fires again, hitting the fallen gunman in the chest.

BOOM!

John fires at the fleeing gunman in the open doorway-



INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

-sending him spinning out into the hallway.

BOOM!
                                                            66.



He is shot a second time in the back, dead in a blink.

David rips off his mask as he slides to a stop, hands up,
just as John emerges from his room, pumping the shotgun for
affect.

A beat... and he walks towards David, the weapon steady.

                                       DAVID
                                 (TREMBLING)
          ...please...

John places the shotgun to the back of David's head.

John is terribly -to an unsettling degree- calm.

He produces a small pill container, taps out two, and
swallows them as he rolls his injured shoulder with a groan.

                                   JOHN
                             (TERRIBLY CALM)
          Do you know where Iosef is?

                                          DAVID


                         Page 84/128
          No, sir.

                                   JOHN
          Do you know where Viggo is?

                                        DAVID
          N-no, sir.

                                   JOHN
                             (SIGHS)
          Do you know anythin' worth knowin'?

Tears roll down David's cheeks as he wracks his brain,
thinking.

                                   JOHN (CONT'D)
          Just because I'm good at killin'...
          doesn't mean I like it all that
          much.
              (a beat, then)
          Give me something.

                                     DAVID
          Wait, wait!
              (swallowing hard, then)
          Little Russia. There's a small
          bank near Cannon Court...

                                     JOHN
          What about it?
                                                         67.



                                    DAVID
           Viggo owns it. It's where he keeps
           his money. Every dollar of
           business he does clears through
           that building.

                                      JOHN
               (a beat, then)
           That'll do.

John swings the shotgun, knocking David out with the butt.


                       Page 85/128
CLICK.

John freezes...

...as HARRY -60s, African-American, former NFL receiver,
tall, lean, and imposing, yet currently dressed in boxers, a
t-shirt, and dress shoes- aims a pistol at the back of John's
head from the open doorway of his hotel room.

Silence.

                                         HARRY
           Do I know you?

                                         JOHN
           I'm thinkin' so.

John turns...

...and Harry lowers his pistol.

                                             HARRY
           Oh.    Hey, John.

                                         JOHN
           Hey, Harry.

Harry glances about at the bodies...

...and steps back inside his room.

                                         HARRY
           Good night, John.

                                            JOHN
                                   (NODS)
           Night, Harry.
               (a beat, then)
           Hey, Harry.

Harry hesitates, but glances out from behind his door.
                                                         68.

                                      HARRY
          Yeah, John?

                                   JOHN
          You keen on earnin' a coin?

                                   HARRY
              (hesitates, then sighs)
          Times bein' as they are? Yeah,
          John... I am.

                                   JOHN
          Do you mind babysittin' the
          breathin' one for, I dunno...
              (checking his watch)
          ...the next six hours or so?

                                      HARRY
          Catch and release?

John tosses Harry a gold coin.

                                         JOHN
                                (NODS)
          Catch and release.

                                      HARRY
          Can do.

We hear the sound of a phone ringing.

Harry grabs David by the feet as John heads back towards his
room.

                                      JOHN
          Good night, Harry.

Harry drags David back towards his room.

                                      HARRY
          Good night, John.

           INT. JOHN'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           John enters his room, and answers the ringing phone.

                                              MANAGER
                     Good evening, Mr. Wick. I'm sorry
                     to be calling you at this hour, but
                     we've received a number of noise
                     complaints from your floor.
                                                                  69.



                                                JOHN
                       You don't have to worry about that
                       anymore. I'll be going to bed
                       soon.

                                                MANAGER
                       Have you any need of -say- a dinner
                       reservation, perhaps?

                                                       JOHN
                       Yes, in fact.

                       Six o'clock?

                                                       JOHN
                       Perfect. Oh, and...
                           (hesitating, then)
                       Do you cater?
                                           (SMILES)
                       Excellent. I'll need a car, and...
                       well... something a bit less
                       trivial.

                                   Page 88/128
Well-lit, but empty; a beautiful expanse of architectural
history.



EXT. A BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

John walks with his hands in his pockets, his head down, lost
in thought. He pauses to light himself a cigarette...

...a long beat...

...and he lowers his head, flicking ash.

                                      JOHN
             You willin' to put a bullet in my
             back, Marcus?

Emerging from the shadows behind him, Marcus holds a silenced-
pistol, his leather-gloved hand steady.

A beat...
                                                            70.



...and Marcus smiles, slipping the pistol back into his
jacket.

                                       MARCUS
            I owe you, John.

Marcus joins him at the rail.

John offers him a cigarette-

                                       JOHN
            Been awhile, Marcus.

-which Marcus accepts-

                                       MARCUS
            Too long, I'd argue.

-leaning forward to ignite the tip from John's lighter.     He
pulls back with a nod, squinting out into the night.

                                   JOHN

          Because if not for me, it would
          have been someone who'd have just
          now pulled the trigger and simply
          walked away, leaving you to gasp
          your last.

                                      JOHN
                             (NODS)
          Much appreciated, then.

                                    MARCUS
          Besides, we're the last of our
          kind; an endangered species of a
          sort. And I find comfort in knowing
          that there's someone like me still
          out there.

                                   JOHN
              (a long beat, then sighs)
          What am I doing, Marcus? I mean...
          it is just a... was a... dog,
          but...

John runs a trembling hand through his hair.

                                   MARCUS
          It's always "just" something, John.

           Marcus turns, and heads back into the train...

           ...as John continues to stare out into the night.

           A long beat... and he produces his cell phone, dialing a
           number.

           EXT. A DINER - ESTABLISHING - EARLY DAY

           A corner dive, popular, but its population is sparse this
           early in the morning.

           A limousine pulls up to the curb.
                                                                      72.


                                  Page 91/128
INT. A DINER - CONTINUOUS

Sipping coffee in a corner booth, John watches the front of
the building...

...lowering his mug as VIGGO -accompanied by two men- enter.

                                   VIGGO
              (in Russian, subtitled)
          Wait in the car.

The two men exit as Viggo walks towards the booth, shedding
his jacket as he does so.

Only one of John's hands is above the table, the other
hovering beneath it, a pistol held tight, unwavering.

Viggo slips into the seat.

                                     VIGGO (CONT'D)
          Is that really necessary?

John answers by taking a sip of his coffee. Viggo shrugs
with a frown, motioning towards the waitress as he flips over
his mug.

                                       VIGGO (CONT'D)
          So be it.

                                     WAITRESS
              (filling the mug)
          Cream or sugar?

                                     VIGGO
          No, thank you.

As she walks away, Viggo takes a long pull off of his drink.

                                     VIGGO (CONT'D)
          It's been what? 30 years?

                                     JOHN


                       Page 92/128
          Yeah, that's about right.

                                   VIGGO
          Left the game, got married, settled
          down... I envy that.
              (a beat, then)
          Kids?

                                         JOHN
          No.
                                                     73.



                                     VIGGO
          Lucky bastard.

                                   JOHN
          We tried, but... wasn't in the
          cards.

                                   VIGGO
          I fucked a bartender and -ta dah!-
          nine months later, I had me a piece
          a' shit tossed on the old doorstep,
          but... when it comes down to it...
                             (GLOWERS)
          He's still my son.

                                        JOHN
                               (NODS)
          I figured as much.

                                   VIGGO
          Funny how one would both die and
          kill for something they do not
          love.

                                   JOHN
          Imagine what one would do if they
          did.

Viggo nods, takes a sip of his coffee, and stands.

                                     VIGGO


                       Page 93/128
          Goodbye, John.

                                     JOHN
          Goodbye, Viggo.

Viggo leaves the diner, and slides into-



INT. A LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

-where four of his men wait, each armed with a silenced,
submachine gun: intimidating hardware.

Viggo closes the door, takes a deep breath, and sighs,
rubbing his brow.

                                       VIGGO
          Kill him.

BOOM!
                                                         74.



A round slams into his window, barely missing him before
hitting the man seated next to him in the side of the head,
blood spattering against glass.

Viggo dives to the floor as his men prepare to return fire-



EXT. A DINER - CONTINUOUS

-but John is a crackshot, firing as he strides towards the
               VEHICLE-



INT. A LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

-killing two men and wounding a fourth who drops down next to
Viggo, screaming.

                                     VIGGO
          DRIVE!




                       Page 94/128
           EXT. A DINER - CONTINUOUS

           John ejects a spent clip, slaps in a fresh one in a blink,
           and unloads into the limousine which jerks forward, tires
           squealing as it drives off.



           INT. A LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

           Viggo lies on his back, staring at the ceiling as he lights
           himself a cigarette.

                                              VIGGO
                     People don't change. Do they,
                     John?
                         (to the screaming gunman)
                     SHUT... THE FUCK... UP!



           EXT. A DINER - CONTINUOUS

           John slips the gun into the back of his pants, turns, and
           calmly walks away.



FADE TO:



           INT. A SUBWAY STATION - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           The train pulls up and begins to empty, crowding the
           platform.
                                                                        75.



           INT. A SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS

           John exits the train, stuffs his hands into his pockets, and
           seeks to disappear into the crowd...

           ...as KIRILL and TWO GUNMEN spot him.

           They move towards him...


                                  Page 95/128
         ...following...

         ...hands reaching beneath their jackets, fingers curling
         around triggers as silenced pistols are slipped free by
         steady hands.

                                               KIRILL
                    Babushka.

         John slows his stride, hands out to his side, mind racing.



SMASHCUT TO:



         INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

         With consciousness fading, John leans back upon the floor,
         listening to the voices of his assailants.

         With his face hidden within his mask, Kirill chuckles -
         enjoying this- as he sucks on a fresh mint.

                              KIRILL (O.C.)
                        (in Russian, subtitled)
                    Then shit... let the fuckin'
                    babushka fade away and let's get
                    the fuck outta' here.



SMASHCUT TO:



         EXT. A SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS

         John tenses, his features hard.

         Kirill grins, willing for John to give him reason to fire.

         Suddenly, a frail commuter stumbles into their midst-

         THUMP!   THUMP!   THUMP!




                                Page 96/128
           -killing each with a single, silenced round to the heart.

           Kirill is dead before he hits the ground.
                                                                   76.



           Amidst a growing sense of chaos, MARCUS shares a parting
           glance with John, slips the pistol in his pocket, smiles, and
           tips his hat down low over his eyes.

           John returns the nod and disappears in the opposite
           direction.

           EXT. A PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           John walks up to an old, FORD LTD sedan. He reaches up into
           a rear wheel well, and rips free a set of keys which had been
           duct-taped within.

           He opens the trunk: we recognize the suitcases therein as
           his own. However, there is also a LARGE DUFFEL BAG as well
           which he opens, studies its contents, and -satisfied- zips
           shut.

           He closes the trunk, opens the front door-



           INT. A SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

           -slides inside, starts the engine-



           EXT. A PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           -and drives off.

           A number of the quaint old buildings share both English and
           Russian signs.



           EXT. A STREET - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           With his hands stuffed deep into his pockets, John exits an
           alleyway and ducks into-



           INT. A CAFE - CONTINUOUS

           -where he motions "one" to the waitress.
                                                                      77.



           She points towards a booth. He nods, sheds his jacket, takes
           a seat, and glances down at the menu.

           Through the window, John studies the front facade of A BANK
           building.

                          HIS POV:

           The BANK MANAGER -checking his watch- flips over the sign in
           the door from CLOSED to OPEN.

                                                      WAITRESS
                      What can I get you?

                                                      JOHN
                      Americano, please.           And a bear
                      claw.

                      On it.

                                                      JOHN
                      Oh, and the bathroom?

           Thanks.



INT. A CAFE - THE HALLWAY - DAY

Pulling on a pair of leather gloves, John walks down the
hallway, but instead of turning left, he turns right-



EXT. A CAFE - THE REAR - CONTINUOUS

-exiting the building.

He flips his jacket inside-out -from black to gray- and slips
on a face mask.

Reaching down behind a trash can, he removes a TWO GALLON
PLASTIC GAS TANK and a PISTOL before walking back down the
alley, and out into-



EXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS

-making a b-line for the Bank.
                                                           78.



As he walks across the street, traffic stops as onlookers
gawk in horror.

John opens the door, and enters-



INT. A BANK - CONTINUOUS

-firing two shots in the air.

                                       JOHN

               (on their looks)
           NOW!!!!

Customers flee, secretaries scramble after them, as does the
Bank Manager...

...who slides to a halt, John's pistol staring down at him.

                                           JOHN (CONT'D)
           Not you.

           But... why not... me?

                                       JOHN
           Take me to Viggo's stash.

                                       BANK MANAGER
           Wha... what?

           What?!?        I can't just-

BOOM!   BOOM!   BOOM!      BOOM!

John fires four shots...

...killing the two gunmen who appeared behind the Bank
Manager.

                     BANK MANAGER (CONT'D)
               (a beat, then hushed)
           This way.
                                                           79.



INT. A BANK - THE VAULT - CONTINUOUS

The Bank Manager swings open the door, revealing two walls of


                        Page 100/128
safety-deposit boxes on either side...

...with a large door in the rear of the vault leading into a
secondary vault. A keypad is attached to its face replete
with a fingerprint reader.

John presses the barrel of the gun to the back of the Bank
Manager's head and forces him into the vault.

                                         JOHN
          Open it.

                                         BANK MANAGER
          I can't.

                                         JOHN
          Open it.

                                      BANK MANAGER
          He'll kill me!

                                         JOHN
          So will I.

The bank manager hesitates...

...and then presses a thumb to the reader and types in a
code.

A beat... and the door opens with a hiss.

                                         BANK MANAGER
          Now, p-

John pistol-whips the Bank Manager, knocking him out.

Without really looking inside-

and unloads the pistol...




                       Page 101/128
...into the gas can which explodes into flame, illuminating
the space to reveal pallets of cash, smuggled artwork,
jewels, and the like stashed therein.

John tosses the pistol inside, and walks away.
                                                            80.



As the fire grows, devouring the millions of dollars in
liquid assets...



EXT. A BANK - THE STREET - CONTINUOUS

John casually walks across the street, ignoring the gawkers,
and enters the alleyway.



INT. A BANK - THE VAULT - CONTINUOUS

The Bank Manager comes to with a groan, pulling himself up to
his feet. His jaw draw drops -eyes wide- at the sight of the
fire.

                                     BANK MANAGER
          ...fuck... me...



EXT. A DINER - THE REAR - CONTINUOUS

John tosses the gloves and mask into the trash, turns his
jacket back out, slips it back on, and enters-



INT. A DINER - THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

-walking down the hallway to enter-



INT. A DINER - CONTINUOUS

-slipping into his seat as the Waitress arrives with his
coffee and donut.

                                                JOHN
                     That'll do. Thank you.

           John takes a deep breath, exhales...

           ...and relaxes as across the street, the Bank Manager emerges
           from the building, and flees off down the street.



FADE TO:



           EXT. A BANK - LATER

           A beat... and the trio of intimidating sedans pull up to the
           curb.
                                                                   81.



           The gunmen in the rear and front vehicles emerge, studying
           their surroundings. A beat... and one of the gunman slaps a
           hand to the roof of the center car.

           Proceeded -and preceded- by a bodyguard, Viggo emerges,
           stuffs his hands into his pockets, and marches into the bank
           as across the street...



           INT. A CAFE - CONTINUOUS

           ...John watches.

                                              JOHN
                                        (MUTTERS)
                     No cops. That's new.

                                                WAITRESS
                     We good, hon?

                                                JOHN
                     Yeah.    Yeah, we're good. Thanks.


                                 Page 103/128
The waitress rips the receipt off of her pad-

                                      WAITRESS
          Anytime.

-and drops it on the table in front of him.

John stands, tosses a twenty down on top of it, turns, and
leaves, snagging a toothpick at the cashier's booth before
exiting.



INT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

As John walks, he reaches down behind a trash can...

...and retrieves a LARGE BRIEFCASE.



INT. A BANK - SECONDARY VAULT - LATER

Viggo stands in the center of the small room with his head
down, prodding a smoldering Picasso with the tip of his foot.

                                   VIGGO
              (in Russian, subtitled)
          Where's the manager?

The question is met by silence.
                                                       82.



                                   VIGGO (CONT'D)
              (in Russian, subtitled)
          I'd run, too.
              (a beat, then in English)
          What a shame... what a fucking...
                             (SIGHS)
          ...shame...

Viggo is trembling with rage, hands clenched at his sides,
eyes unblinking.

                                   VIGGO (CONT'D)

          Iosef... my son... is worth less
          than this... far less... treasures
          reduced to ash...
              (in Russian, subtitled)
          ...ash...



EXT. A BANK - LATER

With his head down -hands stuffed deep into his pockets, a
cigarette smoldering between his lips- Viggo exits, slowly
making his way towards his car.



INT. A DIESEL TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Perched behind the wheel -the driver's side window missing-
John shifts gears, slams his foot down onto the gas...

...and narrows his eyes, tensing, his knuckles creaking from
within leather gloves as his fingers constrict around the
wheel of the stolen vehicle.



EXT. A BANK - CONTINUOUS

The gunmen react to the sound of the engine's roar, the two
nearest it's approach dropping to a knee, aiming, and firing.

Bullets slam into the windshield -a round slashing into
John's cheek, clipping his ear- and engine block before the
front left tire blows.

John loses control of the truck which fishtails wildly,
slamming into a sedan, crushing two gunmen before it
cartwheels through their midst, killing three more before
coming to a stop on its side.

A gunmen pushes Viggo towards the center sedan-
                                                        83.

          GET IN! NOW!

-shoving him inside.

Three gunmen approach the truck, firing repeatedly.



INT. A DIESEL TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Dazed, John -his face cut by glass, fresh wounds seeping hot
blood- reaches over into the open briefcase, removing the
silenced-UZI therein.

John shoots out the sunroof, dragging himself free of the
vehicle as he ducks for cover.



EXT. A STREET - CONTINUOUS

As the Sedan peels out, John swiftly ejects the clip, selects
another -wrapped in blue tape, these ARMOR-PIERCING BULLETS
are dark gray, seemingly sharpened to a tip- from a clip
belt, slaps it into weapon, drops to a knee and-

-as the Sedan drives past-

-depresses the trigger.



INT. THE SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

Bullets easily punch through the doors and windows, riddling
the dash..

...the passenger, the driver...

...the seats...

...one gunmen, Viggo, another gunmen...

...and the seats.




                       Page 106/128
EXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS

The Sedan veers off, plummeting into the store front of a
pharmacy.
                                                        84.



EXT. A BANK - CONTINUOUS

John ejects the spent clip, selects another wrapped in blue
tape, turns towards the fallen truck, and pulls the trigger.

The bullets punch through the roof, seats/floor, and
undercarriage of the vehicle...

...cutting the remaining gunmen to shreds on the sidewalk
behind it.

The clip empties.

Silence.

John tosses the Uzi into the truck, turns, and walks towards
the store front from which the rear half of a sedan
protrudes, pausing to slip free a silenced-pistol from a dead
man's hand.



INT. A PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

John enters, glancing into the Sedan as he moves past: the
gunmen are all dead, but Viggo is missing, a rear door open.

John rounds the corner...

...to see a trail of blood.          He follows it...

...to find Viggo dragging his broken body, his switchblade in
one hand, his cellphone in the other. The knife is
unceremoniously dropped as he struggles to dial 9... 1...

...before the phone slips through his fingers, slick with
blood.


                      Page 107/128
                                    VIGGO
               (in Russian, subtitled)
           NO! NO!
                              (SIGHS)
           ...no...

John stands over him, the pistol level.

As if sensing him, Viggo rolls over with a groan.

                                    VIGGO (CONT'D)
           Tell me, John... and please... be
           honest... am I dying here?

John hesitates, squats, and retrieves Viggo's cell phone.
                                                        85.



                                   JOHN
          Unless I complete the call, then...
          yes.

                                   VIGGO
          For me to die like this...
              (spitting, enraged)
          ...BECAUSE OF HIM...
                             (SIGHS)
          ...would be unfortunate.

Viggo is fading... fast.

                                    VIGGO (CONT'D)
          I was sending Iosef to a safe house
          in Moscow. I arranged for
          transport via... a grain ship...
          out of Newark...

Viggo coughs, trembling.

                                        VIGGO (CONT'D)
          ...please...

John stands, dials an additional "1", and the send button...


                         Page 108/128
           ...but it is too late:      Viggo is dead.

           John tosses the phone down onto Viggo's chest, slips the gun
           into the back of his pants, turns and as he walks towards the
           store front...

           ...grabs a bottle of rubbing alcohol from the shelf,
           unscrewing the cap.



           EXT. A STREET - CONTINUOUS

           John dumps the bottle onto his head, gritting his teeth, as
           behind him...

           ...the sedan EXPLODES behind him.

           John does not react.

           He tosses aside the bottle, stuffs his hands into his
           pockets, lowers his head, and walks on.

           INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           David sits in a chair with his head down: his ankles, wrists,
           mouth, and eyes bound by duct tape. A weathered hand reaches
           over and RIPS the tape off of his eyes.

           David winces out of pain and the brutal sensation of light.

                               HARRY (O.C.)
                     Housekeepin'll find ya'.

           Dressed in a three-piece suit, Harry places an old -but
           gingerly cared for- hat upon his head, a ring upon his finger


                                    Page 109/128
           glistening, his watch an enviable antique.

                     But son? You done a bit a'
                     business on the Continental
                     grounds...

           Harry lifts his suitcase and turns heading for the door.

                     sort a' thing.

           ...and exits, leaving the door ajar.

           David slumps in his seat; exhausted, broken, and defeated.

           SUPER:

           Day becomes night.



           EXT. THE DOCKS - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           A bustling mecca of commerce, the port never sleeps; ships
           of all shapes and sizes dock, empty their shipment, refilled
           with return cargo, and slip out into the night.

           A multi-hulled beast of a ship, THE CHAYKA (Seagull) rests
           dock-side, its bridge guarded by a small army of security
           guards.
                                                                        87.

Overhead, scattered throughout the cranes, are a half-dozen
SNIPERS, searching/studying the dockyard.



INT. THE CHAYKA - THE HULL - CONTINUOUS

Cellophane-wrapped pallets of WEAPONS and bales of CASH are
carried by forklifts into the center of the hull and bolted
to the floor.

Meanwhile, two dozen high-end, luxury cars enter the hull,
each driven into its own reinforced, steel crate, the doors
sealed shut behind them.

As the last WORKER leaves, he shouts into his walkie-talkie.

                                        WORKER
          FILL HER UP!

Overhead, a large chute appears-

endless stream of grain down into the hull, covering the
smuggled goods.



INT. THE CHAYKA - THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Chewing on an unlit cigar, the CAPTAIN -60s, enormous,
grizzled, salt-and-pepper beard, long, unkempt hair, dressed
in denim and leather- studies paperwork at his desk while
Iosef paces; a cigarette in one hand, a drink in the other.

                                    IOSEF
          How the fuck long do I have to stay
          down here?

                         Page 111/128
          your access up top will be limited.

The Captain's phone rings.       He answers it.

                                       CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
          Yes?

The Captain's face falls, his jaw clenched.

                                    CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
          I'll let him know. Proceed as

                                                          88.



The Captain hangs up, finds a match, sparks it to flame, and
ignites the tip of his cigar, puffing it like an old steam
engine.

                                       CAPTAIN (CONT'D)

Iosef is stunned.

The Captain is cut off by the intercom which squawks to life,
a screaming voice reduced to panicked static. The Captain
slaps a hand down onto the call button.

A number of security guards lay dead upon the deck -bleeding

The Captain exits the cabin and slams the door behind him.
Trembling, Iosef latches close the door...

...and pours himself a tall drink.



EXT. A CRANE - CONTINUOUS

A SNIPER searches the yard through his scope, his earpiece
overwhelmed by panicked chatter.

          This is Alpha. I don't-

TINK!

The sniper searches, his skin wet with perspiration, hand
trembling upon the stock.

TINK!

...and another, screaming as he falls...

          WHERE THE FUCK...

JOHN FIRES...

...AND WE FOLLOW THE BULLET BACK UP TOWARDS THE SNIPER'S

His body goes limp...

The parade of SUVs enter the cannery, their tires screeching

stone.



INT. THE CANNERY - THE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

A gunmen rounds a corner...

...stepping over the empty duffel bag we last saw in John's
trunk...

...and freezes, his eyes wide.

HIS POV: A brick of C-4 is attached to one of the main
support beams, the pale red light of the detonator glowing
with ominous disdain.

He takes a step back, lowering his weapon, and glances


                      Page 116/128
about...

...noticing for the first time the RED LIGHTS of a DOZEN OR
MORE C-4 charges scattered throughout the interior.

                                     GUNMEN
           RUN!



INT. BENEATH THE CANNERY - CONTINUOUS

Underwater, John lifts his hand...

...to reveal a REMOTE DETONATER...

...which he depresses with his thumb.
                                                        92.



INT. THE CANNERY - THE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

The gunman goes pale at the sight of all of those red
lights... turning green.



EXT. THE SHIPYARD - CONTINUOUS

A series of powerful explosion tear through the building,
reducing it to splinters as it collapses in upon itself.



INT. BENEATH THE CANNERY - CONTINUOUS

As debris begins to sink down all around him, John swims as
hard as he can.

Surfacing when he is safe, gasping for breath.

Finding a ladder, John climbs upwards-



EXT. THE DOCK - CONTINUOUS

-emerging from behind an access panel.


                      Page 117/128
John turns towards the ship and moves at a steady pace, eyes
roving.



EXT. THE CHAYKA - THE DECK - NIGHT

Surrounded by crewmen and security personnel, the Captain
watches the explosion, his eyes wide.

                                           CAPTAIN
              My... God.

                                        CREWMAN #1
              What do we do?

                                           CAPTAIN
                               I-

POP!   POP!    POP!   POP!

The sound of a pistol echoes up past them.

                                        CREWMAN
              Captain... he's coming.
                                                         93.



EXT. THE DOCK - THE CHAYKA - CONTINUOUS

With his pistol held in both hands -soaked to the bone- John
strides towards the boat's entryway, dropping five guards
with two perfectly-placed shots apiece.

He ejects the spent clips, slaps in a replacement, drops to a
knee, and fires off six shots at the two gunmen as they round
the corner, dead before they hit the ground.

John drops his pistol, retrieves a submachine gun off a dead
guard, unfolds the stock, presses it to his shoulder, and
enters the ship.



INT. THE CHAYKA - THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN - NIGHT


                      Page 118/128
With a trembling hand, Iosef pours himself a drink, staring
at the door...

...from behind which is heard the sound of sheer,
unadulterated chaos: gunfire, screams, and explosions.

Silence.

THUM! THUM! THUM!

                     CAPTAIN (O.S.)
           Open the door, goddammit!

Iosef drops his glass, and unlatches the door.

The Captain stumbles into the room, leaning heavy against his
desk, pausing to take a swig of whisky, blood trickling down
from his forehead, his left arm limp at his side.

The Captain reloads, reaches into his drawer, finds a snub-
nosed .38, and tosses it to Iosef.

                                    CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
           Do you know how to use that?

                                       IOSEF
           Yes, sir.

                                    CAPTAIN
           Good. Follow me. And if you shoot
           me in the back, I'll be the one to
           fuckin' kill you.

The Captain swings open the door, and -with his pistol in
both hands- enters-
                                                            94.



INT. THE CHAYKA - A CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

-bodies lay everywhere.

Gunshots ring out.


                       Page 119/128
A number of panicking crewmen flee the ship.

Iosef stays close to the Captain, his sweaty hands clinging
to the pistol. As the Captain rounds the corner-

                 -COMMOTION-

-as he and John collide.

SLOW MOTION...

...as John looks past the Captain, his eyes locking onto
Iosef...

...who -panicking- raises his pistol, and FIRES-

BACK TO SCENE

-hitting the Captain in the shoulder.

                                   CAPTAIN
          You piece of shit, motherfucker!

Iosef turns and flees...

...as the Captain and John disarm one another.

The Captain roars -in pain and anger- driving a fist into
John's side, breaking ribs. He follows through with a wild
left, but John avoids it, slapping it aside, the Captain's
forward momentum sending his fist to SHATTER again the iron
wall of his ship.

The Captain howls, wrapping his arms around John, crushing
him...

...and as consciousness begins to fade...

...John's teeth close around the captain's nose, cleaving it
from his face.

Stunned, the Captain releases John who kicks out his knee,
moves behind him, wraps his arms around the wounded man's


                        Page 120/128
head, and SNAPS his neck.
                                                            95.



EXT. THE CHAYKA - THE DECK - CONTINUOUS

Iosef emerges from the lower deck, firing back into the
darkness as tears roll down his face.

A beat...

...and John emerges, the very visage of death: his chest
etched with bullet wounds, blood trickling down his face,
wet, dirty, wounded, pale, and yet...

...unstoppable.

John moves at a steady pace, the gun in his hand at his side,
arm limp.

Iosef sprints towards the far end of the ship, and climbs up
the ladder towards the pilothouse.

John follows.



INT. THE CHAYKA - THE PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Overlooking the entire ship's deck, the pilothouse offers
little in the way of escape.

Instead, Iosef now finds himself trapped.

He searches the desk and finds a LETTER OPENER which he
yields like a knife, turning...

...as John enters the room.

Silence.

                                     IOSEF
            Well, come on, muthafucka!   LET'S
            DANCE! YOU AND ME!




                      Page 121/128
A beat... and John raises the pistol, and fires off his last
round, punching a hole in the glass.

Iosef grins, laughing as John drops his weapon.

                                              IOSEF (CONT'D)
            You missed, bitch!

                                               JOHN
            No.   I didn't.

John surges into Iosef...
                                                               96.



...whose hand comes down with the letter opener. John
catches his wrist, and snaps it as his right hand darts up,
constricts around Iosef's jaw, cracking it in two...

...lifting him from with the ground...

                                               JOHN (CONT'D)
                                        (GROWLS)
            For Moose.

...and hurling him through the pane of glass which EXPLODES.

SCREAMING, Iosef tumbles end over end, his body slamming into
chute from which grain continues to pour, the hull close to
full.

Iosef cartwheels over it and lands half-in/half-out of the
hull, SNAPPING his back, as around him...

...grain piles higher...

...as he sinks.

                                                IOSEF
            NO!    HELP ME! NO! N...
                                 (FADING)

While his legs remain on deck, his upper torso sinks
slightly, the grain covering his face, muting his screams...


                         Page 122/128
           ...as he suffocates to death.



           INT. THE CHAYKA - THE PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           John stares down at him for a long moment, turns...

           ...and leaves.



FADE TO:



           EXT. A CITY STREET - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           Silence as a soft snow begins to fall.

           A beat...

           ...and a sedan rounds the corner, takes it too wide, and
           crashes.
                                                                       97.



           INT. A SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

           Perched behind the wheel with his head down, John groans,
           leaning back as snow wafts through the door's broken side
           window.



           EXT. A STREET - CONTINUOUS

           John pulls himself out of the vehicle, stumbles a few feet,
                          ENTERS-



           EXT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           -leans heavy against the wall, and slides into a sitting
           position.

           John Wick looks to be on death's very doorstep....


                                 Page 123/128
        ...however...

        ...death will not take him.

        With an almost frustrated/irritated groan John pulls himself
        to his feet, and staggers down the alley.



        INT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

        Small, simple, and clean.

        A beat... and an elbow is driven through the door's window.
        John reaches in, unlocks the door, opens it, enters, and
        closes it behind him.



        INT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - A SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT

        John grabs an empty box and begins filling it with
        instruments, medication, bandages, and the like.



        INT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - THE BACK ROOM - NIGHT

        John enters to find an empty room...

        ...save a single YOUNG DOG -a mutt of no distinguishable
        breed, three years old- who sits staring at him, offering
        little more than a tilt of its head.
                                                                    98.



        John strips and -using the hose attachment- rinses his body

        clean:
three
        bullet holes (one in his shoulder, one his side, and one in
        his chest).

        John studies the bullet wounds.

                                             JOHN


                              Page 124/128
                             (MUTTERS)
          Through and through... through and
          through...

However when he gets to the one in his chest-

                                        JOHN (CONT'D)
          Buried deep.
                                  (SIGHS)
          Fuck.

John swallows a handful of pills, clenches his teeth, and -
using a pair of needle nose pliers- reaches into the wound,
searching...

...until he finds the bullet which he pulls free.

John cleans the wounds with disinfectant, applies a number of
pads/bandages, and studies himself in the mirror: he is a
complete and total wreck... but alive.



INT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - THE SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT

Searching, John finds some surgical garb; thin pants and a
shirt which he slips into.



INT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - THE BACK ROOM - NIGHT

John takes a jacket off of the rack, tries it on -too small-
moves on to the second one, and it fits. John flicks off the
light, and leaves the room. A long beat...

...and John returns, turning the light back on. From across
the room, he stares at the young dog, studying it.

The dog makes no sound, tilting it's head from side to side.

A beat... and John walks to the cage, removing the clipboard
from its side, reading it: we can see that the dog is
scheduled to be put down tomorrow.

                                            JOHN


                         Page 125/128
                     Miko, huh?
                                                                        99.



           Miko replies with a tilt of her head-

                                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                     That's quite the name.

           -and a paw pressed to the side of the cage.

           John smiles, places the clipboard on top of the cage, and
           opens its door.

           Miko doesn't move.

                                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                     Are you coming or not?

           A beat... and Miko leaps down onto the floor, tail wagging.

                                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                     That's what I thought.

           John takes a leash off of the wall, and clips it to Miko's
           collar.

                                                   JOHN (CONT'D)
                     Come on.     Let's go home.



           EXT. AN ALLEY - NIGHT

           John and Miko emerge from the Veterinarian's Office and walk
           out into the snow...

           ...disappearing into the night.

With his arm in a cast, DAVID makes his way through the

INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE KITCHEN - DRY STORAGE - NIGHT

David enters dry storage, makes his way to the back, and
walks down the staircase.

INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

As he approaches the door, he searches his pocket for a gold
coin, finding one. He slips it into the slit in the door. A
long beat...

...and down below, it clatters out into a small receptacle.

                     WINSTON (O.S.)
           Mr. Perkins...

...over his shoulder, we see Winston emerge from the shadows
behind him, a silenced-pistol held steady in his hand.

                                      WINSTON (CONT'D)
           ...your membership to the

THUMP! THUMP!

Silence.

The sound of a key slipped into an ignition.

It turns, the engine roaring to life, tires squealing.

           Page 1/22
Almost.
"Almost."
Sir, with all due respect,
are you sure
this is our best option?
I mean, why can't we just
correct the problem?
Because my fuckin' nephew
killed a dog.
And he stole a car.
A car,
which currently
is among our inventory.
So we're giving everything up
for a car?
It's not just a car.
It is John Wick's car.
Oh.
Sir, why don't we just
give it back?
He killed my nephew.
My brother.
And a dozen of my men.
Over his car.
And a puppy.
And you...
You think he will stop now?
Hmm?
Sir, he's one man.
Why don't we just eliminate him?
John Wick
is a man of focus...
Commitment...
And sheer fuckin' will!
He once killed
three men in a bar...
With a pencil. I know.
I've heard the story.
With a fucking pencil!
Who the fuck can do that?
I can assure you
that the stories you hear
about this man,
if nothing else,


                                   Page 2/22
has been watered down.
Mr. Wick.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Good dog.
What are you doing, John?
Looking at you.
What are you doing?
I'm waiting for you.
Come here.
Hey, boy.
Nice peaceful place
you got here.
Hey, Aurelio.
Hey.
John, what the hell?
I thought you loved this car.
What do you think?
Well, your motor's
about to fall out
and the chassis's all bent up,
the Driveshaft is all destroyed.
And I don't know if you noticed,
but you got a crack
in your windshield.
I mean...
What do I think?
I could fix this.
Thanks for finding her.
Not a problem, man.
I just made a few calls.
No big deal.
Let me know when it's fixed.
All right.
It'll be ready Christmas...
Ciao, John.
Santino.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
I was sorry to hear
about your wife, John.
Thank you.
Hi.
And the dog,


                                   Page 3/22
does he have a name?
No.
Listen, John,
with all sincerity...
I don't want to be here.
Please, don't.
I'm asking you not to do this.
I'm sorry.
No one gets out and comes back
without repercussions.
I do this
with a heavy heart, John.
But remember,
if not for what I did
on the night
of your impossible task,
you wouldn't be here
right now, like this.
This is because of me.
This, in part, is mine.
Take it back.
"Take it back"?
Take it back.
A marker is no
small thing, John.
For a man to Grant
a marker to another,
is to bind a soul
to a blood oath.
Find someone else.
Listen to me.
What is this? Hmm?
Do you remember?
This is your blood.
You came to me.
I helped you.
And if you don't do this,
you know the consequences.
I'm not that guy anymore.
You are always that guy, John.
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.
Yes. You're right.
You can't.


                                 Page 4/22
But he can.
I'll see you soon, John.
You have a beautiful home, John.
Well, good evenin', John.
Hey, Jimmy.
Gas leak?
Yeah, gas leak.
You workin' again?
I'll see you, Jimmy.
Come on, boy.
Good night, John.
Oh, shit.
I'd like to see the manager.
How good to see you again
so soon, Mr. Wick.
Shall I announce you?
Yes, please.
Stay.
Mr. Wick is on his way
to see you, sir.
Impeccable.
Put these into circulation.
Where is he?
Thank you, my friend.
Beautiful work.
Beautiful.
What are you doing, Jonathan?
He burned my house down.
You rejected his marker.
You're lucky he stopped there.
What the hell were you thinking,
giving a marker to a man
like Santino D'Antonio?
It was the only way
I could get out.
Oh. You call this "out"?
What did you think
was gonna happen?
What did you expect? Huh?
Did you really think this day
was never going to come? Hmm?
What does he want you to do?
I didn't ask.
I just said no.


                                   Page 5/22
Two rules that cannot
be broken, Jonathan.
No blood on continental grounds,
and every marker
must be honored.
Now, while my judgment comes
in the form of excommunicado,
the high table demand
a more severe outcome
if their traditions are refused.
I have no choice?
You dishonor the marker,
you die.
You kill the holder
of the marker, you die.
You run, you die.
This is what you
agreed to, Jonathan.
Do what the man asks.
Be free.
Then, if you want
to go after him,
burn his house down,
be my guest.
But until then...
Rules.
Exactly. Rules.
Without them,
we'd live with the animals.
Do you board?
I'm sorry to say, sir,
but this facility does not.
I, however,
would be willing to accept
the responsibility,
should you wish.
Appreciate that.
Does he have a name, sir?
No.
Good dog.
Stay.
This was my father's collection.
I see little more than just
paint on canvas, of course.


                                   Page 6/22
But I do find myself here.
Please.
I didn't want to do this, John.
Had you stayed retired,
I would have respected it.
Look at you.
You're thinkin' about it,
aren't you?
You're counting exits, guards...
Could you get to me in time?
How would you do it, I wonder?
That woman's pen?
His cane?
Maybe his glasses?
My hands.
Ah.
How exciting.
Yet, you know you
cannot, can you?
I told you I needed that guy,
the way you are looking
at me right now.
I needed the boogeyman.
I needed John Wick.
Just tell me what you want.
I want you to kill my sister.
Why?
There are 12 seats
at the high table.
Camorra, mafia, and Ndrangheta.
The Chinese, the Russian.
When my father died...
He willed his seat to her.
She represents Camorra now.
And I can't help but wonder
what I might accomplish
in her stead.
You want me to kill
Gianna D'Antonio?
I could never do it.
She is my blood.
I still love her.
It can't be done.
She's in Rome


                                   Page 7/22
for her coronation.
You will take
the catacombs in...
It doesn't matter where she is.
That's why I need the ghost,
lo Spettro, John Wick.
That's why I need you.
Do this for me,
and your marker is honored.
What say you?
Never one to waste words.
Fifty-nine, zero, 3.5.
Jonathan!
Julius.
Ciao. Nice to see you.
I fail to recall the last
time you were in Rome.
And here I'd heard
you had retired.
I had.
Then humor me with
but one question.
No.
All right, then.
One of our finest rooms.
And enjoy your stay.
Mr. Wick.
Is the Sommelier in?
I have never known him
not to be.
Good afternoon, Mr. Wick.
It's been a long time.
I'd like a tasting.
I am quite excited
to show you something.
First...
Buongiorno, signor Wick.
Ciao, Angelo.
Welcome back to Rome.
I am.
I know of your past fondness
for the German varietals,
but I can wholeheartedly endorse
the new breed of Austrians.


                                   Page 8/22
Glock .34 and .26.
This is the original map
of the D'Antonio estate.
Here, you have
all the ancient ruins.
Tell me, Mr. Wick, is this a
formal event or a social affair?
Social.
And is this for day or evening?
I need one for day
and one for night.
Recontoured grips.
Flared Magwell
for easier reloads.
And I know you'll appreciate
the custom porting.
What's next?
I need something robust.
Precise.
"Robust. Precise."
This is the map of the temple
and catacombs underneath.
In what style?
Italian.
How many buttons?
Two.
Trousers?
Tapered.
How about the lining?
Tactical.
Ar-15, 11.5-inch.
Compensated with
an ion-bonded bolt carrier.
Trijicon Accupoint
with one-six magnification.
And this is
the modern blueprint.
There are one, two, three gates.
Silicon carbide discs.
Ceramic matrices.
Accompanying laminates.
Cutting-edge body armor.
We just sew it between
the fabric and the lining.


                                   Page 9/22
Zero penetration.
However...
Quite painful, I'm afraid.
Could you recommend anything
for the end of the night?
Something big, bold.
May I suggest the Benelli m4?
Custom bolt carrier release
and charging handle.
Textured grips,
should your hands get wet.
An Italian classic.
Dessert?
Dessert.
The finest cutlery.
All freshly stoned.
Well done.
Could you do a rush order?
I sure can.
Where would you
like to have it sent?
The hotel.
Shall I have everything
sent to your room?
Yes. Thank you.
Excellent.
Mr. Wick?
Do enjoy your party.
Good evening.
Are you enjoying the party?
Mr. Akoni.
Are you enjoying
the festivities?
Please. Sit.
Ms. D'Antonio,
you can't just take
what is rightfully mine.
Nothing was taken.
Those among your own came
to us with these territories.
A knife was pressed
to their throats.
Semantics.
Besides...


                                Page 10/22
That blade you speak of
was meant for their children.
They were only meant to watch.
What is yours is now ours,
Mr. Akoni.
Now go.
Enjoy the party.
Have some fun.
John.
Gianna.
There was a time not so long ago
in which I considered us
as friends.
I still do.
Yet here you are.
What brought you back, John?
A marker.
Held by?
Your brother.
Tell me, John.
This marker...
Is it how you got out?
And what was her name,
this woman whose life
has ended my own?
Helen.
"Helen."
This Helen...
Was she worth the price
that you now seek to pay?
Now,
let me tell you what happens
when I die.
Santino will lay claim
to my seat at the table.
He will take New York.
And you will have been the one
who gifted it to him.
What would your Helen
think about that, John?
What would your Helen
think about you?
Hmm?
Why?


                                   Page 11/22
Because I lived my life my way.
And I will die my way.
Do you fear damnation, John?
Yes.
You know,
I always thought
I could escape it.
That I'd see it coming.
That I'd see you.
John?
Cassian.
You working?
Yeah.
You?
Yeah.
Good night?
Afraid so.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Loose ends?
Yeah...
You're not havin' a good
night, are you, John?
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!
Do I need to remind you
that there will be no business
conducted on
the continental grounds?
No, signore.
No, sir.
Now, may I suggest
a visit to the bar,
so you can calm yourselves.
Gin, wasn't it?
Yes.
Bourbon, right?
Yeah.
I had a marker.
Whose?
Her brother.
I see.
You had no choice.
He wants her seat at the table.
He'll get it now.


                                  Page 12/22
Yeah.
Yeah.
So you're free.
Am I?
No.
Not at all.
You killed my ward.
Someone I was close to.
An eye for an eye, John.
You know how it goes.
Yeah.
I'll make it quick.
I promise.
I appreciate that.
I'll try and do the same.
This round's on me.
Consider it
a professional courtesy.
No. Thanks.
Hello, John.
I understand if you are upset.
And I know it might
feel personal.
But what kind of man would I be
if I didn't avenge
my sister's murder?
John?
Could you let management know
I'll be checking out
in the morning.
Operator. How may
I direct your call?
- Accounts payable.
- One moment, please.
Accounts payable.
How may I help you?
I'd like to open an account.
Name on the account?
John Wick.
Verification?
9305-05.
State of contract?
Open.
Denomination?


                                  Page 13/22
Seven million.
Processing. Please hold.
I appreciate the service.
My pleasure.
You will find
safe passage below.
Transportation is
waiting for you.
May you have
a safe journey, Mr. Wick.
Order confirmed.
What is this?
He completed the task.
The marker is over.
Mark it.
If Mr. Wick
isn't dead already,
he soon will be.
Will you mark it, sir?
You have no idea
what's coming, do you?
I have everyone
in New York looking for him.
I doubt we will see him again.
Do you now?
You stabbed the devil
in the back
and forced him back into the
life that he had just left.
You incinerated
the priest's temple.
Burned it to the ground.
Now he's free of the marker,
what do you think he'll do?
He had a glimpse
of the other side
and he embraced it.
But you, signor D'Antonio...
took it away from him.
He was already back.
Oh, he came back for love,
not for you.
He owed me.
I had every right.


                                 Page 14/22
And now he's coming again.
He did tell you not to do this.
He did warn you.
Please notify MTA personnel
of any suspicious activity.
Your attention, please.
The broad street bound
c train is now arriving.
Your attention, please.
The broad street bound
c train is now arriving.
Next stop, canal street.
This is canal street.
This is the broad street
bound c train.
The next stop is rector street.
This is rector street.
This is the broad street
bound c train.
The next stop is broad street.
This is broad street.
This is the last stop
on the southbound c train.
The blade is in your aorta.
You pull it out, you'll
bleed, and you will die.
This is the end of the line.
Consider this
a professional courtesy.
This is broad street.
This is the last stop
on the southbound c train.
This is the end of the line.
We say things, we see things.
The things you see
are nightmares, man.
Like this one time...
Take me to him.
Tell him it's John Wick.
You know, they just...
They put it in everything!
Hey, man. You got a quarter?
As I live and breathe!
John Wick.


                                  Page 15/22
The man.
The myth.
The legend.
You're not very good
at retiring.
I'm workin' on it.
Mr. Wick doesn't remember,
but we met many years ago,
before my ascension...
When I was just
a pawn in the game.
We met and you gave me a gift,
the gift that would
make me a king.
You don't remember, but there I
was, standing in an alleyway.
I didn't even hear you comin'.
You gave me this.
Gift from the boogeyman.
Perfect for every occasion.
But you also gave me a choice.
Pull my gun, shoot you
in the back, and die.
Or keep the pressure
on my neck...
and live.
And so you see, I survived.
No one sneaks up on me
anymore, thanks to you.
I am all-seeing
and all-knowing.
Then you know why I'm here.
Santino D'Antonio, yes.
Your contract went wide, John.
That's bad for your health.
What's the number
up to now, Earl?
$7 million! Damn!
It's Christmas. We're going
to Applebee's after this.
I need your help.
You have eyes begging for change
on every corner in the city.
I'm thinkin'


                                   Page 16/22
you can find Santino.
I need you to move me.
Underground.
Get me to him.
How sweet it is!
The boogeyman
begging me for help.
Well, of course, John.
Yes, John.
Whatever you'd like, John.
Would you like a back rub
with that, John?
You're going to help me.
Why the fuck would I do that?
Because I'm the only one
that can help you.
You're gonna help me out?
That's downright
upright of you, Mr. Wick.
You sound positively
magnanimous.
But look around you.
How much help does it
look like I need?
It seems to me that the
real question, Mr. Wick,
is who in this cruel world of
ours is going to help you?
There's a storm coming.
Not just for me.
For all of us.
For everyone under the table.
Yes, killing someone who has
a seat at the high table
does create a problem.
But it's your problem, baby.
After all, none of my people
sent Gianna D'Antonio
to the hereafter.
That being said,
Santino has her seat now.
And he wants the city.
When he's done uptown, you think
he's gonna stop at 14th street?


                                   Page 17/22
We'll just have
to take care of ourselves.
Oh, yeah?
For how long?
And how much blood?
You kill Santino,
the Camorra, and the
high table come for you.
I kill Santino,
they come for me.
He's offered $7 million
for your life.
$7 million is a lot
of money, Mr. Wick.
So I guess you have a choice.
You want a war?
Or do you wanna
just give me a gun?
Somebody, please!
Get this man a gun!
Kimber 1911, .45 ACP.
Seven-round capacity.
Seven rounds?
$7 million gets you
seven rounds.
That's a million dollars
a round, baby.
Let's go.
Your descent into hell
begins here, Mr. Wick.
He's at the museum.
Earl will guide you.
Do be careful on your way down.
Oh, and remember, you owe me.
You don't want me owing you.
Welcome, everyone.
Let us toast to the future
of the high table
and of course, to the
memory of my dear sister.
Nice to see you.
Mr. Akoni, how are you?
Wick is here.
Yeah.


                                  Page 18/22
You and you, with me.
You, go.
Welcome to "reflections of the
soul" at the new modern NYC.
Within this exhibition,
the interplay of light
and the nature of self-images
coalesce to provide
an experience
which will highlight
the fragility
of our perception of space
and our place within it.
We hope through this exhibit
we can provide new insights
into your understanding
of the world,
and just possibly lead you
to deeper reflection
into the nature of self.
The marker is complete, John.
You should have just run away.
You know what the Camorra
will do to you.
You think you're old testament?
No, John.
No.
Killing me won't
stop the contract.
Killing me will make it
so much worse.
John,
you know what I think?
I think you are addicted to it.
To the vengeance.
Welcome to "reflections of the
soul" at the new modern NYC.
No wife.
No life.
No home.
Vengeance, it's all you have.
You wanted me back.
I'm back.
You are now exiting "reflections of


                                 Page 19/22
the soul" at the new modern NYC.
We hope that your journey
through the exhibit
has been one of
reflective contemplation
allowing for a new
perspective and insight.
You are now exiting
"reflections of the soul..."
You are now exiting
"reflections of the soul..."
Good evening.
Is the manager in?
The manager is always in.
Winston.
Mr. D'Antonio.
Your evening has
been colorful, I see.
Seeking safe harbor, I presume?
I want his membership
revoked. Now.
In the eyes of this institution,
Mr. Wick has breached
no legalities.
Then you know that I have the
right to demand of you...
Nothing. You demand nothing
of me, Mr. D'Antonio.
This kingdom is mine
and mine alone.
All right.
Then enjoy your kingdom,
Winston, while you still can.
And you its privileges, sir.
I'm here to see
Santino D'Antonio.
He's waiting for you
in the lounge, sir.
Duck fat.
Makes all the difference.
Jonathan...
Have you seen the menu here?
Lot of options. Jonathan,
listen to me...


                                   Page 20/22
A man can stay here a long time
and never eat
the same meal twice.
Jonathan, just walk away.
Yeah, Jonathan.
Walk...
What have you done?
Finished it.
How was he?
He was a good dog. I have
enjoyed his company.
Let's go home.
Mr. Wick?
If you would be so inclined.
Come on, boy.
It has been
a pleasure, Mr. Wick.
Goodbye.
Jonathan.
Winston.
What am I lookin' at?
The Camorra's doubled
Santino's open contract.
It's gone international.
High table?
Mmm-hmm.
And the continental?
You killed a man on company
grounds, Jonathan.
You leave me no choice but
to declare you excommunicado.
The doors to any service or provider
in connection with the continental
are now closed to you.
I am so sorry.
Your life is now forfeit.
Then why am I not dead?
Because I deemed it not to be.
Now.
You have one hour.
I can't delay it any longer.
You might need this...
Down the road.
Winston...


                                 Page 21/22
Tell them.
Tell them all.
Whoever comes,
whoever it is,
I'll kill them.
I'll kill them all.
'Course you will.
Jonathan.
Winston.
Accounts payable.
One-one-one-one-one.
In one hour.
John Wick.
Excommunicado.
Order 11111 confirmed.
