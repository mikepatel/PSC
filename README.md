## Overview
The Passive Sign Convention project is a partnership between two friends, John and Michael, seeking to fuse pop culture with emerging AI technologies. We are NC State engineers (Go Pack!) passionate about Digital Signal Processing (DSP), Communications, Machine Learning, Networking, and even some occasional Podcasting. Our mission is to "Do more with less data over time." Connect with us on LinkedIn, and join our movement!
