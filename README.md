| :-----------------: |
| And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing goong him was red
Losing him was black like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her way
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on |
